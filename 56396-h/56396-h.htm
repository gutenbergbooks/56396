<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>


<p>For much of the valuable information which
the following History of Portuguese Literature
contains, the author acknowledges himself to
be indebted to the communications of a learned
Portuguese, with whom he became acquainted
after the materials he had previously collected
were arranged for publication. M. Bouterwek
originally intended to comprise what he had
to say, on Portuguese literature, in a brief
sketch, which was to form a supplement to the
preceding volume; but the assistance of his
literary friend enabled him to make the present
volume a suitable companion to his history
of the sister literature of the Peninsula.
In England commercial interests may have
induced many persons to make themselves
acquainted with the language of Portugal,
but the literature of that country has hitherto
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
been studied by few. With the exception of
Camoens, even the names of the principal
Portuguese authors are scarcely known to us.
The greater novelty of the subject is therefore
an advantage which this second volume possesses
over the first.

<h3 id="Rise_of_Portuguese_poetry">RISE OF PORTUGUESE POETRY.</h3>

<p>That songs in the Portuguese language were sung on
the banks of the Tagus, before any kingdom of Portugal
existed cannot be doubted. Indeed even Spanish writers,
who have considered the question with impartiality,
do not deny that Portuguese poetry flourished at an
earlier period than the Castilian; and all accounts of
the first dawnings of modern civilization in Portugal
denote an original poetic tendency in the national genius.
That destiny, however, by which Portugal has
been from an early period politically severed from the
other parts of the Peninsula could alone have prevented
the Portuguese poetry from being like the Galician,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
completely absorbed and lost in the Castilian; for the
Galician and Portuguese languages and poetry, were
originally, and even after the separation of Portugal
from the Castiles, scarcely distinguishable from each
other.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>The foreigner, who is not prepossessed by any
national partiality, in favour of either the Castilian or
the Portuguese modifications of the Hispanic romance,
might, perhaps, be induced to conclude that poetry
would on the whole have sustained no essential loss,
had the language of Portugal been rejected by literature,
and reduced like the Galician dialect to the rank
of a common popular idiom; for the Castilian poetry
was from its origin, so closely allied to the Portuguese,
that it is certain the former might easily have incorporated
into itself the latter without producing the
slightest inconsistency in any of its characteristic features.
Still, however, to him who is capable of feeling
the more delicate relations of the beautiful in nature
and in art, it must be an increased pleasure to hear the
same melody performed on two similar, yet differently
constructed instruments. The historian of Portuguese
literature ought, therefore, to direct his particular attention
to those apparently unimportant, and yet in themselves
very remarkable properties, whereby Portuguese
poetry has in the varied progress of its cultivation more or
less deviated from the Castilian, or, as it is now usually
styled, the Spanish;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and also to the manner in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
the differences not only of the two sister languages,
but of the two nations, whose respective characters
are impressed on those languages, have constantly preserved
the boundary which divides the polite literature
of Portugal and Spain, and which must otherwise have
soon been obliterated.</p>

<p>The harmonious softness of the Portuguese language,
probably contributed no less to its early cultivation
in general than to its applicability to poetry in
particular. Even the characteristic nasal sound, which
the pronunciation of this language has in common with
the French, is in no way detrimental to the rhythm of
the Portuguese syllables; for that rhythm, as in the
Spanish and Italian languages, depends on a certain
accentuation, which is a valuable remnant of the latin
syllabic forms, and which is not, as in the French, annihilated
by a new rule of orthoepy. That this ancient
accentuation, and with it the groundwork of metrical
perfectibility, should be preserved in the Portuguese
language, is a circumstance rendered the more remarkable
by that of a French prince having been the founder
of the first dynasty of the kings of Portugal; for from
this incidental occurrence, some critics and philologists
have endeavoured to explain the similarity between the
Portuguese and French pronunciation. The prince to
whose influence this effect has been attributed is Henry
of Burgundy, who was, in the year 1094, appointed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
by his father-in-law, Alphonso VI. of Castile, governor
of the country situated at the mouth of the Tagus, and
who afterwards held that territory in sovereignty with
the title of Count; but however numerous might be the
noble families, brought by this prince from France to
Portugal, neither he nor they could be able to produce
an essential change in the national language among all
classes of the people.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Moreover the same dialect was
and still is vernacular in Galicia, where no French prince
ever ruled. It is however not a little extraordinary,
that under the dominion and influence of French
princes and nobles, Portuguese poetry should from its
origin have preserved unimpaired those romantic national
forms, in which it soon appeared perfectly to
coincide with the Castilian poetry; for notwithstanding
that most of the French nobles, who settled in Portugal,
came from the south of France, whence they
brought with them the genuine poetry of the Troubadours,
still the introduction of that poetry did not
impede the developement of those poetic forms, which
constituted a common source of pleasure for the Portuguese,
the Galician, and the Castilian.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>The favourable situation of Portugal could not fail
to contribute in a considerable degree to the early
developement of the Portuguese tongue. While the
Castilians descending from their mountains, obtained
no increase of wealth until they wrested it sword in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
hand from the Arabs, the Portuguese, particularly after
they recovered possession of Lisbon, enriched themselves
by the peaceful pursuits of trade and navigation.
Lisbon soon became a flourishing commercial city; and
the nation learned to unite civic industry with warlike
achievements. The Portuguese, generally speaking,
acquired a degree of practical dexterity which even to
this day seems to distinguish them from the Spaniards,
and which indeed is not sufficiently valued by the
enemies of the Portuguese name, amongst whom must
be more particularly included their Castilian neighbours.
The benefits of civil industry, which were widely
diffused from Lisbon, fortified in the Portuguese that
feeling of self-esteem, which was necessary for the
maintenance of their independence on so small a
territory. In the reign of Alphonso I. the son of
Henry of Burgundy, the Portuguese dominions acquired
nearly their present extent by conquests made
from the Moors, as far as the Algarvas. The romance
dialect of Portugal now advanced southward into the
conquered districts, and thus acquired the dignity of a
prevailing national language, the formation of which
proceeded from a great capital.</p>


<h3 id="Gonzalo_Hermiguez_and_Egaz_Moniz">GONZALO HERMIGUEZ AND EGAZ MONIZ.</h3>

<p>These circumstances may serve to explain how two
Portuguese poets came to be celebrated at so early a
period as the reign of Alphonso I. in the twelfth century.
One of these poets is Gonzalo Hermiguez, and
the other Egaz Moniz; two knights descended from
the most distinguished families of the country. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
verses of these ancient bards which have been preserved,
are not wholly intelligible even to natives of Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
But though their meaning can only be partially conjectured,
they nevertheless merit attention; for no
Spanish cancion of that age, by any known author,
now exists; and in these oldest records of Portuguese
poetry, the germ of the common character and metrical
form of the national songs of Spain and Portugal is
plainly discernible. Gonzalo Hermiguez and Egaz
Moniz wrote no rhymed chronicles or legends. They
did not even compose in the Provençal metres. Their
lyric effusions, which are popular songs in the proper
sense of the term, are composed in short trochaic verses,
precisely in the style of the well-known Spanish and
Portuguese ballads of the fifteenth centuries. In the
verses of Hermiguez scarcely any regular measure is
discernible.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> But Egaz Moniz exhibits precisely that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
metrical form, for which, during some succeeding centuries
the Portuguese and the Spaniards manifested a
particular predilection.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>These oldest relics of lyric composition in the
Portuguese language seem to confirm the opinion, that
the prevailing tone of romantic love, which characterised
the poetry of the Spaniards and Portuguese,
until the imitation of the Italian style was generally
adopted, originated in Portugal. To paint romantic
despair, and all the storms of passion, combined with
the deepest resignation, existing not only in fancy, but
in real life, appears to have formed the poetic costume
of chivalry in Portugal even earlier than in Spain.
Thus, the susceptible Egaz Moniz is said to have survived
only a short time the poetic expression of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
anguish occasioned by the infidelity of his beloved
Violante.</p>


<h3 id="Early_essay_in_epic_poetry">EARLY ESSAY IN EPIC POETRY.</h3>

<p>In all literary probability, the Portuguese also preceded
the Spaniards in essays in epic, or rather in
historical poetry. An old Portuguese narrative in
dactylic stanzas (<i>versos de arte mayor</i>), whose unknown
author related, as well as he was able, the
history of the conquest of Spain by the Moors, may
not be so old as it is supposed to be by Manuel de
Faria y Sousa, who would refer the origin of these
verses to the very period of the Arabic invasion. They
are, however, written in such antiquated language, that
they may be regarded as of a date anterior to the Cantigas
of Hermiguez and Moniz; and that they are the
surreptitious fabrication of a later writer can scarcely
be supposed, since no one could have hoped to acquire
the least fame or reward by producing a counterfeit of
so little value. No opinion could be formed of the
merits of the whole narrative from the few stanzas,
which are now extant, even though the language
were more intelligible than it is.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>


<h3 id="King_Diniz">KING DINIZ.</h3>

<p>In general all these remains of the most ancient
Portuguese poetry must be considered only as first
attempts. Throughout the whole of the thirteenth
century, the poetic art in Portugal appears to have
remained stationary in that degree of advancement
to which it had arrived in the twelfth century. The
language, however, became gradually more fixed and
regular. In the latter half of the thirteenth century,
king Diniz (Dionysius) of Portugal, promoted Portuguese
literature in the same manner as his contemporary
Alphonso the Wise, by his influence and example,
improved the poetry of Castile. Diniz, like Alphonso,
was himself a poet and a prose writer. His poetic
compositions were, according to the fashion of the age,
collected in <i>Cancioneiros</i> (song books), which bore the
name of the author. But from the testimony of Portuguese
writers, it appears that the poems of king
Diniz are to be found only in old manuscripts. They
cannot, however, be very few in number, for two <i>Cancioneiros</i>
are named, one containing the spiritual, and
the other the temporal works of the king. The first of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
these collections bears the singular title of <i>Cancioneiro
de Nossa Senhora</i> (Our Lady’s Song book).<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> King Diniz,
in whose reign trade, and with it the third estate particularly,
flourished in Lisbon, founded in the year
1290 the national university. This institution was
first established in the capital, but it was soon transferred
to Coimbra, where it is still maintained, in a
great measure, according to its original forms. It is
one of the oldest universities in Europe. No accounts
have been preserved of any other Portuguese writers,
who, following the example of their king, may have
more or less distinguished themselves in the cultivation
of the national poetry; though at this period celebrated
names might the more naturally be expected, as two
poets had flourished in the twelfth century. But the
Portuguese bards, who, in the thirteenth century delighted
their contemporaries by their poetic compositions,
shared no better fate than the writers of the
oldest Spanish canciones and romances.</p>


<h3 id="Poets_of_the_royal_family_in_the_fourteenth_century">POETS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY IN THE FOURTEENTH
CENTURY.</h3>

<p>The fourteenth century is not much richer than the
thirteenth in names, which shed a lustre on the history
of Portuguese poetry. Scarcely any writers of verse
are recorded, except those who were members of the
royal family, as if they were considered the representatives
of all the contemporary poets of their nation.
Alphonso IV. who reigned from 1325 to 1357, pursued
with regard to poetry the same course as his father, King
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Diniz. Affonso Sanchez, a natural son of Diniz, appears
to have been gifted with a similar poetic talent.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
But the writings of Affonso Sanchez are not now to be
found even in manuscript; and those of King Alphonso
IV. have never been printed. Pedro I., who was the
son of this last mentioned sovereign, and whose unfortunate
connection with the beautiful Inez de Castro,
has given him a romantic celebrity, seems to have found
the Castilian language, which then vied with the Portuguese
in cultivation, as well adapted as his native
tongue to the poetic expression of his feelings. A Castilian
poem by Pedro I., which begins in short verses, like
a cancion, and proceeds in the measure of the Italian
canzone, has been preserved, in addition to some compositions
in Portuguese, which are also attributed to
that monarch.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> If Dom<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Pedro’s poem be authentic, it
proves that the Italian poetry had an influence on the
Portuguese, even at a period when the Castilian had
not yet fully developed itself in the old national forms.
But this early influence of Italian poetry is also proved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
by some Portuguese sonnets of the fourteenth or fifteenth
century. An old sonnet, in praise of Vasco de
Lobeira, the author of Amadis de Gaul,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> is by some
writers ascribed to Alphonso IV., King of Portugal,
and by others to the Infante Dom Pedro, the son of
John I., who was born in the year 1392.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> It is scarcely
worth while to enter into minute investigation merely
for the purpose of settling this dispute. Admitting the
problematic sonnet to be really the production of the
Infante Dom Pedro, and therefore written, at the earliest
in the commencement of the fifteenth century, it is
certain that at that period no imitation of the Italian
style was thought of in Castile. In Portugal, however,
the metrical form of the sonnet was not only known, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
it also was in Castile; but the Italian style was likewise
imitated in sonnets. The Infante Dom Pedro translated
some of Petrarch’s sonnets into Portuguese.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> It may
therefore without hesitation be inferred that Dom Pedro,
who has never been mentioned as having struck out a
new path on the Portuguese Parnassus, merely followed
the example of some of his countrymen who lived before
him. It is probable, that the mercantile intercourse
between Lisbon and the ports of Italy, made the Portuguese
early acquainted with Italian literature. But
at the period now under consideration, the imitation of
the Italian style appears to have been very limited in
Portugal; for the old lyric poetry in the national style,
began about this time more particularly to unfold its
characteristic beauties. According to the testimony of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
a Spanish writer,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> the Portuguese <i>Cancioneiro Geral</i>
contains some poems of the fourteenth century, with
the names of the authors affixed to them.</p>


<h3 id="Chronicles_in_Prose">CHRONICLES IN PROSE.</h3>

<p>In the fourteenth century too, Portuguese prose
improved in precision, after a certain degree of literary
consideration had been given to it, in consequence of
chronicles being written in the national language.
From this period the Portuguese vied with the Castilians
in the patriotic task of recording the memorable
events of their national history. The style of the Portuguese
chronicles of the fourteenth century is, however,
completely in the chronicle manner.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Indeed the Portuguese
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
literature of the fourteenth century presents no
prose work, which in point of style equals those written
during that period, in the Castilian language, by the
Infante Juan Manuel.</p>


<h3 id="Intimate_connection_of_the_Portuguese_and_Galician_poetry">INTIMATE CONNECTION OF THE PORTUGUESE AND
GALICIAN POETRY&mdash;THE GALICIAN POET MACIAS.</h3>

<p>In Portugal as in Spain the fifteenth century was
the period during which the old national songs and romances
flourished in the greatest luxuriance. Since
that time Portuguese and Spanish poetry have in general
occupied the same degrees of cultivation, and
have lent to each other a mutual support, though
neither stood in need of the other’s aid. The correspondence
between the Castilian and the Portuguese
poetry, was at that time particularly promoted by the
Galician poets, who though faithful subjects of the Castilian
monarchy, still remained true to their mother
tongue. Galicia seems to have been the land of romantic
sentiment whence the poetry of love exhibited in the
lyric compositions of Spain and Portugal was transplanted.
No Portuguese or Spaniard is so celebrated
in poetic literature, for the influence of love on his fate,
as the Galician poet and knight Macias, who lived in
the first half of the fifteenth century, and of whose
remarkable history a brief sketch may properly be
introduced here. Macias, who obtained the surnames
of the <i>enamoured</i> and the <i>great</i>, distinguished himself
as a brave warrior against the Moors of Granada, and
as an accomplished writer in the literary retinue of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
Marquess of Villena.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> But though the marquess appreciated
the merits and talents of Macias, he did not approve
the romantic passion with which that enthusiast
interwove his poetic fancies into the affairs of real life.
The marquess strictly prohibited him from continuing a
secret intrigue in which he had embarked with a lady,
who, through the intervention of the marquess, had
become the wife of another knight. But Macias conceived
that he could not better prove his chivalrous
constancy in love, than by boldly disobeying the commands
of his patron. The marquess, however, availing
himself of his power as grand master of the order of
Calatrava, sent the refractory poet a prisoner to the
kingdom of Jaen, on the frontiers of Granada. In his
captivity Macias composed his songs of ill-fated love in
the Galician language, which at the period of their
production were highly esteemed, but which are now
lost with the exception of a few trifles.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> He contrived
to forward copies of these songs to his mistress. On
the discovery of the correspondence, the poetic boldness
of Macias roused the husband of the lady to the most
furious pitch of jealousy. Armed cap-a-pee, he set out
with the intention of slaying the unfortunate poet.
He proceeded to the town of Arjonilla, where Macias
was confined, and espying the prisoner at a window,
he threw a javelin at him, and killed him on the spot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Some idea of the sensation which this affair produced
may be formed from the contents of the old Spanish
<i>Cancionero</i>, in which it is frequently mentioned. But
the story has more properly its place in the history
of Portuguese poetry. The Spanish amatory poets,
however extravagant might be their extacies in verse,
confined themselves, in real life, within certain boundaries,
which were consistent with the habits of society.
The Portuguese, on the contrary, and as it
would appear, the Galicians likewise, when they indulged
in the poetic expression of violent and enthusiastic
feelings of love, conceived that it was still necessary they
should seek to impress the stamp of perfection on their
songs, by exhibiting all kinds of sentimental excesses in
their own personal conduct. The Spaniards seem always
to have felt convinced that they could not attain
the romantic tenderness of the Portuguese.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> A certain
simplicity and intensity in the expression of tender
sentiments, to which the language of Portugal is particularly
favourable, has always been one of the characteristic
features of Portuguese poetry, from the
fifteenth century down to the present times.</p>


<h3 id="The_Cancioneiros_Geraes">THE CANCIONEIROS GERAES.</h3>

<p>But in order to pursue the comparison between the
romance and lyric poetry of Portugal and of Spain, an
intimate acquaintance with the old Portuguese <i>Cancioneiros
geraes</i> (general song books), is indispensable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Collections of this kind seem to have appeared as early
as the fifteenth century. Writers on literature, however,
usually refer to the <i>Cancioneiro</i>, which was
printed in the year 1516, by Garcia de Resende, a
man of talent, who flourished at the courts of John II.
and Emanuel the Great.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> A later collection of the
same kind, which was edited by Father Pedro Ribeyro,
professor of poetry, in the second half of the sixteenth
century, has never yet been printed. The manuscript
is dated 1577.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> According to the statements of
writers who seem to have been acquainted with Garcia
de Resende’s work, it would appear that this old Portuguese
<i>Cancioneiro</i> contains many more poetic names
than the better known Spanish collection of the same
kind, and that among these names are several writers
who lived in the fourteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Here the author
of this history of Portuguese literature, who has vainly
endeavoured to render himself acquainted with Garcia
de Resende’s interesting collection, must deplore that
he is now compelled to leave a chasm which cannot be
easily filled up; for this certainly is the place in which
it would be most proper to endeavour to discover, in those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
features, which were doubtless common to all, or at
least to most of the Portuguese lyric bards of the fifteenth
century, the nature of the original difference of
Portuguese and Spanish genius. It may, however,
be presumed that the Portuguese poets, who were at
this period so much more numerous than the Spanish,
had advanced no farther than the latter in poetic refinement,
for even Bernardim Ribeyro, called the Portuguese
Ennius,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> who lived until the commencement
of the sixteenth century, and who is more celebrated
than any other poetic writer of the fifteenth century,
does not surpass the authors of the old Spanish ballads,
in any thing connected with the cultivation of genius
and the improvement of poetic language. Thus in all
literary probability the Portuguese <i>Cancioneiro geral</i>
is merely a companion work to the Spanish collection.
But the preponderating number of the poetic writers
of Portugal, compared with those of Spain during the
fifteenth century, is a circumstance particularly deserving
of notice, since it proves that the soil of Portugal
was then, as well as at an earlier period, even
more fertile than Spain in poetic genius. Still, however,
this indicates no peculiarly eminent talent. It is also
but fair to observe, lest the superior number of the
Portuguese poets, in proportion to the limited extent
of their native land, should be too highly estimated,
that in the fifteenth century, the Castilian monarchy was
not what it now is; for it was bounded on the south by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
the Moorish kingdom of Granada, and on the east by
the Arragonian dominions, where the Limosin language
exclusively prevailed.</p>


<h3 id="Deficiency_with_regard_to_historical_romances">DEFICIENCY WITH REGARD TO HISTORICAL ROMANCES&mdash;LITTLE
INFLUENCE OF THE CULTIVATION
OF LATIN VERSE ON PORTUGUESE LYRIC
POETRY.</h3>

<p>Narrative and particularly historical romances seem
never to have been so highly esteemed by the Portuguese
as by the Spaniards. It is probable that in this class of
composition the Portuguese merely imitated the Spaniards,
whom they instructed, on the other hand, in
bucolic poetry.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>The enthusiasm with which the Portuguese devoted
themselves to the cultivation of lyric poetry in their
native tongue, was not abated by the passion for latin
poetry, which towards the close of the fifteenth century
prevailed in Portugal as well as in Italy. This literary
coincidence was probably occasioned by the commercial
intercourse which then subsisted between Portugal and
Italy. The fame of Angelo Poliziano attracted one of
his most ardent admirers, the ingenious Henrique Cayado,
better known by the name of Ermigius, from Portugal
to Italy, where he entered the ranks of the revivers of
latin poetry. Cayado was imitated by a considerable
number of Portuguese writers who became celebrated for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
the composition of latin verse.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> But it does not appear
that the national poetry, in the vernacular language,
was in any way neglected or despised by the Portuguese
nobility; and the favour of the great exercised a more
powerful influence over the poetic spirit of the nation,
than the example of the learned. There is also very
little ground for supposing that the Portuguese writers endeavoured
to form the romantic poetry of their country
on the model of the antique. A correct notion of the
essential distinction between romantic and classic composition
secured at this period the Portuguese as well as
the Italians against the introduction of incongruous and
spurious forms in their poetry; and taste was not yet
sufficiently cultivated to admit of a judicious union of
the classic and the romantic styles.</p>


<h3 id="Early_cultivation_of_historical_prose_in_Portuguese_literature">EARLY CULTIVATION OF HISTORICAL PROSE.</h3>

<p>The general improvement of the language, and the
renewed intimacy with ancient literature, had even as
early as the first half of the fifteenth century an advantageous
influence on the Portuguese chronicle writers.
At this period a very copious chronicle of the reign of
King John I. of Portugal, was written in the Portuguese
language, by a knight and statesman, named Fernando
Lopes. This writer distinguished himself as early as
the reign of King Duarte, or Edward, whose successor,
Alphonso V. in the year 1449, conferred on him the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
dignity of <i>Cronista</i>, or state-historiographer.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> The
narrative style of this diligent compiler is, indeed, quite
as dull and monotonous as that of the older Portuguese
chroniclers; but he obviously made efforts to express
himself with a certain degree of dignity. He neglects
no opportunity of making his historical characters deliver
speeches, after the manner of the ancient writers; and
a certain degree of energetic simplicity is to be found in
some of those harangues.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>


<h3 id="Increase_of_Portuguese_Power">INCREASE OF PORTUGUESE POWER, FOLLOWED BY
THE RAPID DEVELOPEMENT OF THE NATIONAL
POETRY AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SIXTEENTH
CENTURY.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile the Portuguese monarchy approached
the summit of its power and glory. While Spain,
under the dominion of Ferdinand and Isabella, began
to form itself internally into a single state, the government
and people of Portugal directed their attention to
discoveries and conquests in Africa and India. A peculiar
union of the heroism of chivalry, and the industry
of social life which prevailed in Portugal, under the
auspices of her enterprising sovereigns, impressed on
the nation a consciousness of power, in which the Portuguese
were in no respect inferior to the Castilians.
The flag of Portugal waved along the western coast
of Africa, where Portuguese factories began to be
converted into colonies, extending towards the Cape
which Vasco de Gama doubled in the year 1498. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
less than fifteen years after this memorable event,
Portuguese valour, guided by the renowned leaders
Francisco de Almeida and Alfonso de Albuquerque,
succeeded in founding a kingdom in India, of which
Goa was the capital. At this period, during the
glorious reign of Emanuel, who in the series of Portuguese
sovereigns is distinguished by the surname of
the Great, no Spanish poet had attained so much celebrity
as was enjoyed by the Portuguese Bernardim,
or (according to the more ancient orthography of that
name) Bernaldim Ribeyro. A comprehensive idea of
the nature of that romantic spirit, which every Portuguese
poet conceived himself bound to exhibit in the
fulfilment of his poetic destination, may be gathered
from an account of the life and writings of this extraordinary
man.</p>


<h3 id="Bernardim_Ribeyro_24">BERNARDIM RIBEYRO.</h3>

<p>This poet received such a literary education as was
in those times required for the study of the law, and
a subsequent residence at court. King Emanuel,
conferred on him the appointment of <i>moço fidalgo</i>
(gentleman of the chamber). Ribeyro found at the
court of that sovereign an object capable of fixing his
poetic fancy, but not his future happiness; for from
that time forward the heart of this sentimental enthusiast
appears to have been incessantly agitated by
sad emotions. Portuguese writers insinuate that the
Infanta Dona Beatrice, the king’s daughter, was the
lady of whom the unfortunate Ribeyro was enamoured.
It is evident from his writings, that he has studiously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
thrown a veil over the secret of his heart. We are not
informed how he reconciled this passion with his domestic
relations, or whether at the period of his marriage
he had emancipated himself from those romantic
illusions which at other times exercised so powerful
a dominion over him. It is related that he frequently
retired to the woods where he passed the night alone,
singing to the murmuring brooks his songs of passion
and despair. But it is also said that he tenderly loved
his wife, and after her death showed no inclination to
enter, a second time, into the married state. There
is no possibility of reconciling these psychological inconsistencies,
since it is not known at what period of
his life Ribeyro retired from court. Neither is it
recorded at what period or at what age he died. But
that he cherished romantic fancies in real life, as well
as in his poetry, is a fact which is sufficiently confirmed
by the accounts which have been preserved of
his conduct and by the general character of his writings.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p id="His_eclogues_25">Among the poetic works of Ribeyro, so far as they
are known, his eclogues are particularly distinguished.
If not the very oldest, they are certainly among the
most ancient compositions of the kind in Portuguese
and Spanish literature; and when compared with those
of Juan del Enzina, who flourished about the same
time in Spain, they may, in every respect, claim the
priority. Juan del Enzina ingeniously sported with
simple ideas; but Ribeyro sang from his inmost soul.
However, even Ribeyro is poor in ideas. His language
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
and composition are very remote from classical correctness,
and his prolixity is tedious. But amidst the
monotony of Ribeyro’s homely verses, there appears
a spirit of truth and poetic feeling, which no art or
study could have produced. The eclogues, which
are unquestionably the production of Ribeyro’s pen,
are four in number; but a fifth in the same style is
attributed to him. They are all composed in <i>Redondilhas</i>,
arranged in stanzas of nine or ten lines each,
called <i>decimas</i>. Like most compositions in the class to
which they belong, these eclogues assume the form of
tales; but the lyric garb in which the simple materials are
clothed, is the most interesting circumstance of the whole.
Ribeyro has described in his eclogues only the scenery
of his native country. The Tagus, the Mondego, the
sea on the coast of Portugal, and even sometimes the
city of Coimbra, and other towns, are exhibited in a
poetic point of view. The names usually given to the
shepherds are, Fauno, Persio, Franco, Jano, Sylvestre;
but among the shepherdesses we find, a Catharina and
a Joana introduced. Certain peculiarities and mysterious
allusions sufficiently betray the object of the poet, which
was to represent the romantic situations and events of
the fashionable circles in which he moved at the court
of Lisbon, under the poetic disguise of situations and
events of pastoral life. In conformity with the notions
of the age, this kind of disguise was, from its affinity to
allegory, highly valued; and it afforded the poet an opportunity
of unfolding the sentiments of his heart, to
the mistress whom he dared not name, without the fear
of compromising either her or himself. Ribeyro’s fancy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
revelled in this union of truth and fact with truth of
poetic feeling. The characters in all his eclogues are
nearly the same under different names, and among
them an unhappy lover is always the most conspicuous.
The fervent expression of tenderness and
despair on the part of the lover, forms the soul of these
little pastoral pictures.</p>

<p>Ribeyro’s poetic style is in its principal features the
old romance style, only here and there somewhat more
luxuriant, and occasionally interspersed with antiquated
conceits. The unaffected truth of some of the descriptions
is heightened by a peculiar kind of rural grace,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
and even the uniform repetitions and plays of words
in the lyric passages are, in general, not destitute of
poetic interest.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> The enthusiast must be forgiven for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
the application, certainly not very ingenious, of his own
name, which he has sometimes allegorically disguised
by the word <i>Ribeyra</i>, (a river,) and sometimes introduced
as the real name of a shepherd; but the shepherd
is in the same way reminded of a beautiful river,
which is intended as the allegorical representative of a
lady, who under the name of <i>Ribeyra</i>, is the object of
<i>Ribeyro’s</i> adoration.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Some of these antiquated conceits
are, however, dignified by warmth of expression.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>
But upon the whole, Ribeyro’s eclogues are nothing
more than the heartfelt effusions of a poet, who with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
all his tenderness and depth of sentiment had not
sufficient energy to strike out a new course for himself.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p id="His_cantigas_30">The <i>Cantigas</i> of Bernardim Ribeyro unquestionably
bear the characteristic stamp of the fifteenth
century. They may be ranked on an equality with
the best pieces of the same kind in the old Spanish
<i>Cancionero</i>. Like them they paraphrase an idea
which is set down at the head of the poem, and thus
appear in the form of glosses, without being confined
within a certain number of lines. The idea is as in
Spanish, called the <i>mote</i> (motto). That which the
Spaniards term a <i>glosa</i>, is by the Portuguese denominated
a <i>volta</i> (turn); and the title <i>Cantiga</i>, which the
Portuguese give to a composition of this kind, seems,
like the Spanish term <i>Villancico</i>, to have been borrowed
from the ecclesiastical hymns.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> One of Ribeyro’s Cantigas
is remarkable for the boldness with which the
poet, in his character of a married man, very unequivocally
marks the distinction between his wife and the
lady who is the object of his regard, and assures this
lady that only his hand and not his heart is wedded.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
If this Cantiga be really founded on truth, a question
with which the critic has, generally speaking, little
concern, it not only weakens the authenticity of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
accounts respecting Ribeyro’s tender attachment to his
wife, but also serves to explain the studied obscurity of
the allusions which prevail throughout the whole of
his writings; and in this last respect the question is of
some interest to the critic. A sextina imitated from the
Italian forms, but in trochaic verses, which are besides
pure redondilhas, is likewise among the number of
Ribeyro’s poems. In addition to these Cantigas,
which are, however, but little known,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> there has been
preserved a narrative romance of the idyllic kind, which
by some favourable accident has even found a place in
one of the old Spanish Cancioneros, where it is also
attributed to Ribeyro.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> This romance, which is allegorical,
contains plays on the name of Ribeyro, and
veils the glowing anguish of the poet under a singular
obscurity of ideas and images. The romantic
mysticism and deep fervour of expression, which
distinguish it, sufficiently attest its authenticity.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p id="His_romance_of_Menina_e_Moca_33">But a work, by this author, which is of greater
extent, and which exhibits the first remarkable attempt
towards the improvement of romantic prose in the
Portuguese language, remains to be noticed. This
work is a kind of romance which Ribeyro appears
to have written in his mature years, and which he
did not complete. The name given to it <i>Menina e
Moça</i>, (meaning “a young and innocent maiden,”) is a
repetition of the three first words with which the story
begins, and therefore is not susceptible of precise translation
in the form of a title.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> In point of intricacy
this fragment has no parallel in the whole range
of romantic literature. The mysterious Ribeyro has
here employed all the powers of his inventive fancy,
in giving utterance to his enthusiastic feelings, and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
minutely expressing the sentiments of his heart; while
at the same time he has confounded and changed characters
and events so as to secure every circumstance
and allusion against malicious interpretation. Thus a
reader in the nineteenth century is at a loss to unravel
the entangled composition, and it being merely a fragment,
is a circumstance which increases the difficulty.
No alchymist ever bestowed more pains on the enigmatical
dressing of his doctrine of the philosopher’s stone,
than Ribeyro has taken to envelope his romance in a veil
of obscurity. It is asserted, nevertheless, that with all
this caution he was afraid to lay it openly before the
public; and in fact the book did not become known
until after his death. It is impossible to form any
probable conjecture as to the ultimate object of the author.
The commencement of the tale, or if it must be
so called, the preface, is put into the mouth of a sentimental
female character who has withdrawn from the
gay world to a wild solitary spot on the Portuguese
coast. This lady, whose name is not mentioned, relates
that while she was yet <i>Menina e Moça</i>, she was carried
from her father’s house to foreign lands. From that
period, doomed to lead a life of wretchedness, alone,
among the rugged cliffs, she bewails her never-ending
sorrows, beholding only on the one hand the unchangeable
mountain tops, and on the other the ever restless waves
of the sea.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> In this manner the anonymous female continues
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
her narrative, and describes her inconsolable
condition. She states, that by way of amusement,
though of a melancholy kind, she has devoted herself
to the task of writing “this little book,” (<i>este livrinho</i>),
which is intended to unfold her sufferings and her
errors. From this introduction the reader impatiently
expects the history of the nameless lady, who has now
excited his interest. But here the confusion and intricacy
commences. The supposed authoress states,
that in her solitude she had discovered another lady
no less unfortunate than herself. She introduces this
lady, who in her turn begins to relate her history.
This new character throws the first completely into
the back ground. She expatiates on the virtues befitting
knights and ladies, and sheds tears of regret for
the departed days of chivalry. She states that the
wild valleys to which she has retired, were once the
scenes of memorable and brilliant events: and here the
reader is again disappointed, for instead of relating her
own adventures, as is naturally expected, she commences
an intricate and romantic story of love and
heroism, the period of which is laid in the ages of
chivalry. This story is in fact the romance which
Ribeyro wished to write. What the author intended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
by the two-fold frame-work of his romance, and the
superfluous history related by the one lady to the other,
is an enigma that cannot be solved without a knowledge
of the private life of the poet, circumstances of
which are supposed to be ingeniously concealed under
these forms of art. Ribeyro very dextrously makes his
fair narrator observe that, as a woman, she is not qualified
to speak minutely, and at length concerning the
achievements of knighthood; but that with respect to
the affairs of the heart she is enabled to say all that is
necessary. Thus he has spared himself the trouble of
exercising his descriptive talent on a branch of the
history, the details of which he was not inclined to
follow.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to furnish an abstract of the
tale of love and heroism which forms the subject of this
romance. Even on a perusal of the whole, so great is
the obscurity, that nothing can be comprehended of the
circumstances, without the utmost effort of attention.
That Ribeyro has clothed in the disguise of this story,
the most interesting events of his own life, is a fact
which admits of no doubt; for the contrivance which
he adopted with the view of concealing his personal
implication, by the intricate arrangement of his romance,
is disclosed with the greatest simplicity. The really
artless Ribeyro, having so far disguised himself, conceived
that by transposing the letters of real names, he
did all that was necessary to avoid compromising the
individuals of his acquaintance, whom he introduced in
his romance, arrayed in the garb of ancient chivalry.
Thus <i>Alvaro</i> is converted into <i>Avalor</i>, <i>Joana</i> into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
<i>Aonia</i>, and <i>Bernardim</i>, the christian name of Ribeyro
himself, is changed into <i>Bimnarder</i> and <i>Narbindel</i>.
The unconscious simplicity of these transpositions corresponds
with the whole tone and style of the romance.
The monotony of incessant love complaints renders the
prolixity of the narrative still more tedious; but even
amidst that monotony and prolixity, it is easy to recognise
a spirit truly poetic, more remarkable, however,
for susceptibility than for energy. Some of the sentimental
passages are distinguished by the charm of a
most tender and pathetic sweetness. This characteristic
appears even in the introduction, where a story is told
of the death of a nightingale, which being perched on
the branch of a tree overhanging a brook, dies while
singing, and dropping into the brook is carried away by
the current, along with the fallen leaves.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> The reader
is surprised by these delicate plays of feeling, no less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
than by many occasional reflexions, which though trivial
in the present day, were at the commencement
of the sixteenth century by no means common. Thus
allusion is made to the absurd notion of women
in imagining they can secure the heart of a lover
by the same persevering service which pleases themselves
in the other sex.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> By traits of this kind, and
by the simple truth of description, this old Portuguese
romance is sufficiently distinguished from the common
class of romances of chivalry, which during the sixteenth
century, became in a great measure the fashionable
reading of the Spaniards and Portuguese. Spanish
literature at that period could not boast of any work
written in so cultivated a style, and yet that style soon
afterwards became somewhat antiquated. From some
passages in which allusion is made to Galician phrases,
it is evident that the Portuguese in the age of Ribeyro,
carefully distinguished their native tongue as a cultivated
language, from the Galician, which had now
become a common popular idiom.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>In the polite literature of Portugal, Bernardim
Ribeyro stands on the boundary of the old national
and the modern taste, which at the commencement of
the sixteenth century, began to be developed in Portugal
as well as in Spain, in consequence of the imitation
of the Italian style. In spite of all their defects
and deformities, Ribeyro’s verses as well as his prose
romance, deserve to be honourably remembered, since
they present remarkable monuments of the romantic
character of the Portuguese at the period when the
national greatness of that poetically organized people
began suddenly to decline. A remnant of that character
must, however, still be preserved, even by the
Portuguese of the present day, otherwise a new edition
of Ribeyro’s romance would not at the end of the
eighteenth century, have been presented to the Portuguese
public, as a proof of the excellence of a language
in which such a work was written.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>


<h3 id="Christovao_Falcao_39">CHRISTOVAÕ FALCAÕ.</h3>

<p>Among the contemporaries of Ribeyro the most distinguished
was Christovaõ Falcaõ, or Christovam Falcam.
He was a knight of the order of Christ, an
admiral, governor of Madeira, and a celebrated poet
in the age in which he lived. A long eclogue by this
writer, which forms an appendix to the works of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Ribeyro,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> so completely partakes of the character of
the poems which it accompanies, that were it not for
the separate title it might be mistaken for the production
of Ribeyro himself. It therefore proves that Ribeyro’s
poetic fancies, his romantic mysticism, not excepted,
were by no means individual. The fashionable
form of the poetry of melancholy love in Portugal, was to
complain and yet ostensibly affect to conceal itself. Thus,
Christovaõ Falcaõ, by a slight change of his own christian
name, gives the name of <i>Crisfal</i> to the shepherd
who poetically represents himself. The subject of the
poem is the love of <i>Crisfal</i> and <i>Maria</i>, the shepherdess
who is the heroine of the eclogue. This shepherdess
is evidently a real personage, and it is mentioned by
writers on literature that the poet’s mistress had the
same Christian name; she was a <i>Maria Brandam</i>.
The rural scenery described in this eclogue, like that
in the poems of Ribeyro, is all national: the Tagus,
the Mondego, and the rocks of Cintra, are introduced
here as in Ribeyro’s romance. The story is simple.
Two lovers are separated by the severity of their
parents. The shepherd relates his sorrows, and calls
to mind his past days of happiness. This reminiscence
gives birth to a kind of tale which is interwoven
with the complaints of the shepherd. The verses are
redondilhas, and the eclogue consists of upwards of
ninety of the ten line stanzas called decimas, exclusive
of some cantigas in shorter stanzas, which are interspersed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
through the work. The language and style,
particularly in the lyric complaints, are even more
antiquated than Ribeyro’s. The most truly beautiful
portion of the poem is the description of a brief interview
and renewed farewell between Crisfal and Maria,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
particularly towards the close.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The poet throws a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
veil of mystery over the subsequent fate of Crisfal,
and does not choose to hint whether the hapless shepherd
survives. A nymph who has heard his complaints
inscribes them on a poplar, in order, as it is said, that
they may grow with the tree to a height beyond the
reach of vulgar ideas.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> So delicate a winding up of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the story would not have entered into the imagination of
every amatory bard.</p>

<p>Portugal may therefore be regarded as the true
native land of romantic pastoral poetry, which, however,
about the same period flourished in Italy, where
it assumed more cultivated forms, particularly after Sanazzaro
had written; but in Portugal alone was it properly
national. Two Portuguese writers, Saa de Miranda
and Montemayor transferred this style of poetry to
Spanish literature.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>Among the works of Falcam, there is a kind of
poetic epistle, if it may be so called; but he wrote no
didactic epistles. This poetic epistle is in fact merely
a lyric romance, which the author has addressed to his
mistress in the form of a letter, when, as the superscription
expressly mentions, he had secretly married
her contrary to the will of her parents; an act for
which he incurred the penalty of five years imprisonment.
From his prison he addressed verses to his
lady.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Thus it also appears that this Portuguese poet,
who afterwards discharged, probably with honour to
himself, the duties of admiral and governor, wished
to make the same romantic principles the basis of his
conduct and his writings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>


<h3 id="Other_ancient_lyric_poems_44">OTHER ANCIENT LYRIC POEMS.</h3>

<p>It is probable that the lyric pieces which are annexed
to the old edition of the works of Ribeyro, and
which immediately follow the poems of Falcam, were
written by the latter. They belong entirely to the
class of Villancicos in the Spanish Cancioneros. They
are, for the most part, cantigas or glossed mottos; but
some are entitled <i>Esparças</i>, or overflowings of the
heart.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> In all these songs the plays of antiquated
chivalrous wit are very affectedly blended with genuine
effusions of the heart. They are, however, like the
old Spanish canciones, throughout enlivened by a glimmering
of poetic truth; and even the old fashioned
conceits successfully contribute to express intensity of
feeling. This is particularly the character of the
mottos, which appear to be more remarkable for far-fetched
quaintness, than the old Spanish compositions of
a similar kind. The following may serve as examples:&mdash;“I
saw the end at the beginning; I see the beginning
at the end; so that I know not whether I am beginning
or ending.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> “Since in beholding you, lady, I have lost
the knowledge of myself, do not you do against me,
that which for your sake I have done against myself.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
“At variance with myself, great is my danger, for
I can neither live with myself nor fly from myself.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
Some mottos are, however, expressed in a more simple
and popular form; but it is remarkable that those
which are most inartificial, or destitute of point, are
precisely those of which the glosses are more particularly
distinguished by nature and grace.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> The Portuguese
of this age seem to have been much less disposed
than the Spaniards to pourtray in their lyric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
poetry the continual conflict between passion and
reason. Like the Italians the Portuguese gave free
utterance to the emotions of the heart, and were only
induced to seek after quaint ideas, by an eager desire
that the vehemence and depth of their passionate feelings
should be energetically and ingeniously expressed.</p>

<p>It would appear that at the commencement of the
sixteenth century the romantic pastoral and lyric styles
were the only species of poetic composition to the cultivation
of which the Portuguese directed their attention.
No evidence appears to exist of any remarkable
essay in dramatic poetry, before the time of Gil Vicente,
who will hereafter be noticed. It is probable that unimportant
treatises on poetry and versification, in the
style of that which Juan del Enzina wrote in Spanish,
existed at the same period in the Portuguese language;
and on a comprehensive view of the polite literature of
Portugal, previous to the introduction of the Italian
style, it will be found that like the true sister of Spanish
literature, it was, in an equal degree, susceptible of
the reform which presented itself to both.

<h3 id="Relation_of_Portuguese_to_Spanish_poetry_47"><i>Relation of Portuguese to Spanish Poetry in the Sixteenth
and Seventeenth Centuries.</i></h3>

<p>The original relationship between Portuguese and
Spanish poetry paved the way for the adoption of the
Italian style by the former; for when that style became,
during the sixteenth century, naturalized in Spain, a
similar change soon followed in the national taste and
poetic forms of Portugal. The political conflicts of the
two nations did not either then, or at any former period,
disturb the harmony of their common poetic feeling.
Though the distinctive features in the national character
as well as in the language of the Portuguese
and Spaniards, might be traced with more precision
than heretofore, yet the general customs of both nations
remained the same, and the demands of their respective
tastes which had been awakened in nearly the same
manner, required to be satisfied by similar means.
Every species of poetry was not, however, received
with equal favour in Spain and Portugal; nor did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
every style of poetic composition find in each country
a poet whose genius was capable of elevating it to
particular distinction. In those nations, as elsewhere,
fate has, by incomprehensible laws, sometimes summoned
the right spirit at the right hour, and has
sometimes denied the art to the artist when all external
circumstances appeared most favourable, and when
the perseverance of emulative competitors was most
conspicuous. Thus Portugal cannot boast of a Cervantes,
and Spain has given birth to no Camoens.</p>

<p>The Portuguese had raised their country to the
same height of political glory as Spain, when their
poets began to vie with the Spanish in the ingenious
imitation of the Italian forms. After Columbus had
discovered America for Spain, as Vasco de Gama had
the new way to the East Indies for his own countrymen,
the Portuguese lost no time, at least on the eastern
coast of the new world, in seizing a share of the rich
booty claimed by the Spaniards. The Florentine Amerigo
Vespucci in the service of King Emanuel of Portugal,
explored a part of the new continent, the whole
of which has since borne his name. The papal line of
demarcation which divided the newly discovered heathen
regions between Spain and Portugal, was equally flattering,
though circumstances prevented it from being
equally advantageous to both powers. The Portuguese
was like the Spaniard, proud of his achievements; and
before the mines of Peru had given the highest impulse
to Spanish self-esteem, Portugal was already
enriched by her Indian treasures. If during the
thirty years reign of John III. (from 1521 to 1557)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
the Portuguese government shewed itself wanting in
wisdom, it was not deficient in energy. Even the
exertions made to maintain sword in hand, the Portuguese
dominion in India, against the constant hostility
of the natives, augmented the military strength of the
nation, though they proved injurious to its commercial
interests. Under these circumstances the bold spirit of
commerce was in no danger of degenerating into a
petty trading spirit; and the romantic character which
Portuguese poetry had from its origin always displayed,
could without difficulty develope itself under new
features, particularly when the poet himself, like Camoens,
was at once a hero and an adventurer.</p>

<p>After the period of the highest greatness of the
little kingdom of Portugal had long passed away, its
effects still operated powerfully on the spirit and the
literature of the nation. To be obliged to become
Spanish subjects, on the extinction of their old royal
family, deeply mortified the Portuguese; but the shadow
of ancient national independence which the cabinet of
Madrid found it necessary to concede to Portugal, was
sufficient during the whole period in which that country
continued under Spanish domination, to maintain in full
force the old national hatred between the two countries.
This was carried to the highest pitch of exasperation
in the hearts of the Portuguese, when they found that
in spite of the seeming independence of the kingdom
of Portugal, the foreign powers with whom Spain
waged incessant war, paid no attention to the distinction
between Spanish and Portuguese possessions;
and that the Dutch in particular availed themselves of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the favourable opportunity to treat the Portuguese
as Spaniards, and to deprive them of those valuable
possessions in India, for which they were indebted to
the enterprising spirit and courage of their ancestors.
It required no great political penetration to discover
that the most productive source of Portuguese national
prosperity had thus become obstructed, and that in all
probability such a misfortune would not have occurred
had Portugal preserved her independence. Even the
nobility and the ecclesiastics, who, contrary to the express
wish of the people, had favoured the claims by
which Philip II. of Spain was declared Philip I. of
Portugal, could not possibly be warm partisans of a
government which oppressed the whole country by an
absurd and despotic system of administration. During
the sixty years therefore in which Portugal felt the
weight of Spanish supremacy, every patriotic Portuguese
regarded the three Philips, who ruled over his
native country, merely as kings of Portugal, unfortunately
residing in Madrid. Lisbon continued to be
the real Portuguese capital. The ministerial departments
of state were still concentrated there; and in
conformity with the treaty by which the crown was
ceded to Philip, all the public offices in Portugal were
filled by native Portuguese. In Lisbon, too, the Portuguese
language maintained its ancient consideration
in the courts of law, in the polite world, and in
literature, though it was not very readily adopted by
Spaniards.</p>

<p>The national peculiarities which, even under the Spanish
dominion, continued to distinguish the Portuguese
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
from the Spaniards, were attended by consequences
remarkably favourable to Portuguese literature, when
at last, in the year 1640, the long prepared blow was
struck, which rescued Portugal from the yoke of the
Spanish sovereigns, and placed John of Braganza on
the throne amidst the acclamations of the people. At
this period, Spanish poetry had already declined, while
on the contrary Portuguese poetry once more revived.
The general re-action against every thing Spanish had
an inspiring influence on the Portuguese poets, even
though they took no part in political affairs. If no
second Camoens arose in that age, it nevertheless gave
birth to several poets, whose lyric compositions honourably
maintained the reputation of their country; and
they were eminently successful in gathering the last
blossoms of the poetry of romantic love, which had
taken the deepest root in Portugal.</p>


<h3 id="Causes_of_the_continued_cultivation_of_the_Spanish_language_51">CAUSES OF THE CONTINUED CULTIVATION OF THE
SPANISH LANGUAGE IN PORTUGAL.</h3>

<p>To causes of a totally different nature and in which
political interests were but remotely concerned, must be
attributed the zeal with which the Portuguese, in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, cultivated the language
and literature of Spain, along with their mother
tongue and the learning of their own country; while
the Spaniards of the same period regarded the Portuguese
poetry as a mere scion of the Spanish, and besides,
generally speaking, looked down with contempt on the
language and literature of Portugal. That this unequal
conduct of the two nations was not the effect of political
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
causes, is evident from the favour which the Portuguese
poets extended to the Castilian language, in the first
half of the sixteenth century, when certainly no expectation
was entertained of the union of the two
kingdoms. Even at that period it was a custom, and
indeed a high style of fashion in literature for Portuguese
poets to write verses in Castilian as well as in
their mother tongue. Saa de Miranda, the poet with
whom the most brilliant period of Portuguese literature
commences, also holds a place among Spanish poets.
Compositions in the Castilian language are indeed interspersed
through the works of all the Portuguese
poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; but
nothing could be more extraordinary than to find either
verse or prose written in the Portuguese language by a
Spaniard.</p>

<p>This phenomenon, which seems to be at variance
with Portuguese patriotism, may, however, be explained
by the peculiar relations which the Castilian and Portuguese
languages bear to each other. The Castilian
language has an imposing character which is wanting
in the Portuguese; and though the stateliness of the
Spanish diction might seem formal and affected to the
Portuguese in general, it was likely to make a forcible
impression on their poets. The pleasing fluency of the
Portuguese tongue, could not, however, operate so
favourably on the poets of Spain, for to a Spanish ear
the most elegant Portuguese has merely the effect of
broken Castilian.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> The Portuguese were indemnified
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
for the Castilian guttural, which so much displeased
them, by the sonorous accentuation of the Castilian
words; but the Spaniards found much of this accentuation
lost in Portuguese by abbreviations of the very
words in which it occurs in Spanish. The Castilian
too was regarded as the more dignified tongue, because
its unabbreviated words, for which it is indebted to
the latin, excited more precise recollections of the
language of ancient Rome.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> It is probable also, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
Castilian pride after the union of the Castilian and
Arragonian provinces contributed its share in rendering
the Spaniards insensible to the peculiar beauties of the
Portuguese language. On the contrary, the flexibility
of the Portuguese character more readily accommodated
itself to foreign forms. Finally, the dependence of the
whole government of Portugal on the court of Madrid,
during the space of half a century, rendered the knowledge
of the Castilian language indispensable to those
Portuguese who were destined to fill the first ministerial
departments in their native country; but the Spaniards
had no such inducement to learn Portuguese, as they
were not permitted to hold any public office in Portugal.
Thus did the Spanish language during the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, acquire that degree of consideration
in Portuguese literature which it afterwards
maintained. It should besides be recollected, that during
the period in which Portugal continued under the dominion
of Spain, a great portion of the bookselling
trade had been transferred to Lisbon, the first commercial
city in the two united kingdoms; and trifling
as this circumstance may at first sight appear, it cannot
be doubted that it co-operated to the diffusion of the
Spanish language in Portuguese literature.</p>


<h3 id="Religious_and_political_character_of_the_Portuguese_during_this_period_54">RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL CHARACTER OF THE
PORTUGUESE DURING THIS PERIOD.</h3>

<p>The polite literature of Portugal experienced no
disadvantage from certain traits of difference in the
Spanish and Portuguese character and manners. The
Portuguese who were less addicted to pomp than the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
Spaniards, were also less inclined to religious fanaticism.
The monarchs of Portugal, it is true, exerted their
utmost endeavours to inflame the religious prejudices
of their subjects, and to teach them to revel in the
same delirium of barbarous orthodoxy as the Spaniards.
John III. in whose reign Portugal attained the highest
pinnacle of her power, did not neglect formally to introduce
the Spanish inquisition into his dominions; and
the jesuits, who had now begun to excite the alarm of
every catholic monarchy, Spain excepted, were in the
year 1540, received into Portugal by the same sovereign
who proposed to avail himself of the aid of those enterprising
defenders and propagators of the old catholic
faith, for the conversion of the infidels in both Indies.
He consigned to the jesuits the education of his grandson
Sebastian, who was his successor on the throne; and
the example of the monarch was doubtless imitated
by many families of rank. Thus, literary education
seems to have been still more jesuitical in Portugal
than in Spain; and the dreadful pile, on which heretics
were immolated, was lighted up often enough to blunt
the moral feelings of the people. But these horrid festivals
of superstition accorded less with the Portuguese
than the Spanish character. Of the two nations the
Portuguese were in disposition the more tolerant, and
they continue so to be.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> On this account the spiritual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
comedies, with which the Spanish public was never
satiated, obtained only a transitory success in Portugal.
If, then, the fetters imposed on conscience proved only
slight restraints to poetic genius in Spain,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> still less
could any considerable injury arise from such influence
on polite literature in Portugal.</p>

<p>At this period poetry and eloquence were not in
Portugal much more than in Spain indebted to support
from the throne. The poetic art was nevertheless held
in esteem and honour at the court of John III. The time
had, indeed, gone by in which the kings of Portugal
competed for the laurels of Apollo, and shone conspicuous
among the bards of their native land. From
the reign of Emanuel the Great, to the period when
the dynasty of that monarch became extinct, the kings
of Portugal were more disposed to encourage adventurous
enterprises in the two Indies than to devote
themselves to the cultivation of poetry. John III.
however, seems to have possessed a strong taste for
dramatic amusements; at least it is related that he
himself used to perform parts in the plays of Gil
Vicente, which were represented at his court. Sebastian,
the ardent disciple of the jesuits, was occupied
in the fulfilment of his presumed destiny to extend the
glory of his faith and his name by romantic achievements,
until in the fatal conflict, by which he hoped to
render himself master of Fez and Morocco, he was lost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
among the lifeless wreck of his defeated army: and
Camoens, the no less ardent disciple of the muses,
whose enthusiasm in his sovereign’s cause was both
patriotic and poetic, was left by Sebastian to languish
in bitter poverty. Old Cardinal Henry, though a lover
of literature, found, on ascending the throne, sufficient
occupation in providing for the political welfare of the
country. That the Spanish kings who next governed
Portugal bestowed little or no attention on Portuguese
poetry and eloquence, is a fact to which it is scarcely
necessary to advert. On the accession of John of Braganza,
it is probable that the government would have
done more for the national drama, which had hitherto
been left to work its own way, had not the Portuguese,
after the death of the inventive Gil Vicente, fallen
further behind the Spaniards in dramatic composition
than in any other class of poetry. The royal patronage
now arrived too late. Portugal possessed no national
drama like that of Spain; and for the non-existence of
that branch of literature the people and not the government
must be held responsible. The causes which
prevented dramatic poetry in Portugal from attaining
that degree of excellence to which it arrived in Spain,
will be noticed in their proper place, in so far as they
can be ascertained or conjectured. The distinguished
favour, however, which the Italian opera at length obtained
from the court of Lisbon was not only unprofitable
to Portuguese national poetry, but contributed to banish
it still further from the stage. There was of course now
less reason than ever to hope for the establishment of a
genuine and well cultivated national drama in Portugal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>To the Portuguese nation must be attributed the
excellencies and the defects which Portuguese poetry
and eloquence presented throughout the whole of this
period. In Portugal, no poet, who wished to distinguish
himself within the sphere of his art, presumed
to dictate legislatorily to the national taste. No one,
by striking out a new path, sought to explore the unbeaten
regions of his native Parnassus. No sects, like
those which occasionally arose in Spain, disturbed the
poetic harmony of the Portuguese poets, whose various
voices were always attuned in national concord. The
influence which the Italian poetry gained over the Portuguese
was recognised with equal willingness by the
poets and the public. It cannot, however, be denied
that this national harmony of the Portuguese poets
during the most brilliant period of the polite literature
of their nation, gave rise to a certain spirit of self-satisfaction,
which though very favourable to subordinate
talent, was by no means calculated to awaken genius.
The higher beauties of the poetic art were not scrupulously
demanded: to secure success it was sufficient
that an author should elevate himself in a slight degree
above the common makers of verse. Romantic ideas
tolerably versified in pleasing language were all that a
Portuguese poet found necessary in order to secure the
esteem and the eulogy of that public on whose decision
his reputation depended. Eminent poetic merit could
be appreciated by very few, and it received no particular
encouragement or uncommon reward. Thus it
happened that the state of poetic public spirit among
the Portuguese created no demand beyond an extensive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
improvement of the national poetry. The great mass of
the people adhered to the old romance style; while the
nobility, men of education, and finally, all who wished
to mingle in fashionable society, preferred the Italian
forms, on which, however, the Portuguese national
impress was always discernible. But the majority of
the poets whose names acquired celebrity, belonged to
noble families;&mdash;for in Portugal, as in Italy and Spain,
every one who wished to gain distinction at court, or in
the army, or as a well educated man of the world,
composed verses; and even ecclesiastics who were anxious
to gain the good graces of the fair sex, found it
necessary to lay claim to poetic cultivation. Among
the princes of the royal house, the Infante Dom Manoel,
who stands in a kind of poetic relationship with Saa de
Miranda, seems to be the last who was distinguished
for writing passable verse.</p>

<h3 id="Tranquil_adoption_of_the_Italian_style_59"><i>Tranquil Adoption of the Italian Style.</i></h3>

<p>The introduction of the Italian style into Portuguese
poetry was unaccompanied by any remarkable
struggle or sensation. No mention is made by writers
on general literature, of the existence of a party strenuously
opposed to that style in Portugal; and even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the works of the Portuguese poets present few or no
traces of any literary conflict on the subject. That a
change which excited so violent a storm in Spain passed
tranquilly in Portugal, was certainly not owing to indifference
on the part of the Portuguese in matters of
taste. But the Portuguese most distinguished for cultivation,
were not attached to the old romance poetry
by so decided a predilection as the Castilians. Besides,
as has already been stated, that class had become, at an
early period, acquainted with Italian poetry. Some of
the Italian syllabic metres might already be regarded
as vernacular in Portugal, and the spirit of Italian
poetry was certainly not unknown to the Portuguese,
since they had, from an early period possessed
translations of some of Petrarch’s sonnets. Thus
the way was already traced out for the thorough reform
of the old taste, and the natural flexibility of the
Portuguese character was more easily reconciled than
Castilian stubbornness to that reform. When, therefore,
even Spanish poets had set the judicious example
of improving their national poetry, an opposition which
would have appeared the mere imitation of an unreasonable
party spirit was not to be expected in Portugal.
Finally, the poet with whose works the new epoch in
Portuguese poetry commences, so successfully seized the
delicate tone by which the union of the Italian and
the old Portuguese styles was to be accomplished, that
the national taste found in him precisely what it required,
and the innovation was accommodated to the
Portuguese character under the most pleasing forms.

<h3 id="Saa_de_Miranda_61">SAA DE MIRANDA.</h3>

<p>The romantic Theocritus, Saa de Miranda, one of
the most distinguished poets of the sixteenth century,
has already been noticed in the History of Spanish
Poetry.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> He shines indeed more conspicuously among
the Spanish than the Portuguese poets; but in his native
country he stands at the head of a poetic school. The
present is, therefore, the fit place to relate the necessary
particulars of his biography.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>Saa de Miranda, the descendant of a noble family,
was born at Coimbra, in the year 1495. His parents
destined him for the study of the law, and wished, if
possible, that he might become professor of jurisprudence
in his native city. To occupy the chair of a
teacher of law was at that period considered an object
worthy of the ambition of persons of rank; and to
take an interest in the prosperity of the university of
Coimbra was found to be a strong recommendation to
the favour of the sovereign. Saa de Miranda had but
little taste for jurisprudence, yet, for the sake of pleasing
his parents, he pursued his study of legal science
until he obtained the degree of doctor. He was afterwards
appointed to a professorship, and is said to have
distinguished himself by his lectures. But on the death
of his father, Saa de Miranda immediately bade farewell
to jurisprudence, and resolved to live after his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
own taste. We are not informed what age he had
attained at this period. That his character was, however,
truly poetic, is sufficiently obvious, not only from
his writings, but from several anecdotes which are
related of him. In mixed companies he often sat in a
state of silent abstraction, without observing or being
aware that he was himself observed. Tears would
sometimes flow from his eyes, without any apparent
cause, and he himself was so little conscious of their
presence, or cared so little to conceal them, that if any
one happened to address him, he would, while he suffered
himself to be quietly drawn into conversation,
frequently forget to dry his moistened cheeks. He
cherished a particular desire to travel; and this inclination
he gratified when filial duty no longer bound him
to the professor’s chair. He declined the offers of King
John III. who, in order to detain him would have provided
for him in another way, and proceeded to Spain, where he
probably acquired a more intimate knowledge of the
Castilian language than he had before possessed. He
next travelled to Italy, and visited the cities of Venice,
Rome, Florence, Naples, and Milan, where he found
sufficient opportunities for rendering himself intimately
acquainted with the Italian poetry. On his return to
his native country he was appointed to a place at court,
and enjoyed the favour of the king. He was now
accounted one of the most accomplished courtiers in
Lisbon, notwithstanding the cast of melancholy which
still distinguished him. His pastoral poetry, however,
peaceful as its character was, involved him in a dispute
with a Portuguese nobleman, who discovered in
an eclogue some allusions which he applied to himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
The quarrel having become warm, the poet
found it necessary to quit the court. He retired
to his estate of Tapada near Ponte de Lima, in the
province of Entre Minho e Douro, where he devoted
himself wholly to his literary studies, and to the
cultivation of rural and domestic happiness. Next to
poetry, he took most interest in practical philosophy.
His acquaintance with ancient literature was sufficient
to enable him to enrich his books with passages from Homer,
in the form of marginal notes. He also understood
music, and was a performer on the violin. Notwithstanding
the gentleness of his temperament, he was fond of
chivalrous exercises, and took particular delight in
hunting the wolf. He lived happily with his wife,
though she was not handsome nor even young at the
period when he married her. During his life, his
poetic fame was widely spread. Several poets, who
reflect honour on their native country, particularly
Antonio Ferreira and Andrade Caminha, formed themselves
chiefly on the model of Saa de Miranda. His
two comedies so highly pleased the Infante Cardinal
Henry, that they were performed in the palace of
that prince, before a company of prelates, and other
persons of rank. After the poet’s decease these comedies
were printed by order of the cardinal. Having
reached the sixty-third year of his age, he died universally
admired and beloved, at Tapada, in the year
1558.</p>

<p id="General_character_of_his_poems_63">No trace of resemblance to a style produced by
imitation, distinguishes the works of Saa de Miranda
from the more ancient Portuguese poetry. What he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
learnt from the Italians was a genuine though not perfect
refinement of the old Portuguese style, under more
beautiful forms. He was indeed, and ever continued
to be, too true a Portuguese to aim at the highest
degree of Italian correctness, though it appears, from
what he has himself stated, that he was most industrious
in the revisal of his works.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> According to his
own declaration, it also appears that he did not rely
with much more confidence on systematic criticism,
than on the fickle approbation of the public. That
feeling under the dominion of which he always lived
and moved, was, in the dernier resort, his critical rule
and guide. The Italian models only directed him to
the course which he himself would naturally have
adopted. To use his own expression, he culled flowers
with the muses, the loves, and the graces.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>Had Saa de Miranda been in a greater degree an
imitator than a self-dependent poet, his sonnets would,
doubtless, have been more numerous; for he was peculiarly
fitted, from his knowledge of the delicacies of
the Italian style, to shine in that form of composition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
But his Portuguese as well as his Spanish sonnets are
few in number; and those of the tender cast, like the
sonnets of Boscan, and most of the Spanish writers,
entirely harmonize with the old national tone. Besides
indulging himself in the use of masculine rhymes, he
represented the complaints of love in the old strain of
despair, and contributed his share in pourtraying the
endless conflict between passion and reason.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> But
he particularly excelled in painting the soft enthusiasm
of love,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> and his sonnets acquire a peculiar
colouring from the mixture of pastoral simplicity,
which he could never entirely exclude from his style
of poetic representation. The reiterated allusion to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
the joys and sorrows of human existence, and the
transitoriness of all things, is a grecian trait in the compositions
of this poet.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p id="His_eclogues_66">The romantic pastoral world was the native sphere
of Saa de Miranda’s muse. The greater number and
by far the most beautiful of his eight eclogues are, however,
in the Spanish language, for he wrote only two
in Portuguese. It can scarcely be doubted, therefore,
that Saa de Miranda considered the Spanish language
to be more expressive or more elegant than the
Portuguese, or that for some other reason he preferred
it to his mother tongue; and yet as far as a foreigner
may presume to judge between the two languages, his
choice ought to have been reversed, for the Portuguese
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
seems expressly formed for romantic pastoral poetry.
Perhaps Saa de Miranda thought, without being himself
clearly conscious of entertaining such an idea, that
it was more poetic to give dignity to the soft pastoral
style, by the help of the sonorous Castilian tongue,
than to suffer it to be altogether naturally expressed
through the medium of the Portuguese idiom. For
the character of his pastoral style was to be romantic
and wholly national, to resemble the idyllic style of
Theocritus only in the simplicity of rural expression,
but by no means to be popular, in a prosaic sense.
Whether Saa de Miranda’s shepherds and shepherdesses
converse in Spanish or in Portuguese, the rural scene is
always laid in Portugal. On this account the first of the
two Portuguese eclogues of this modern Theocritus, is
partly unintelligible to the foreigner, who possesses only
a literary knowledge of the peculiarities of the rural
idiom of Portugal. The poet himself observes, at the
conclusion of his dedicatory stanzas to the Infante Dom
Manoel, that he discourses in a new language.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> The new
language here alluded to is produced by a delicate blending
of the turns most remarkable for graceful simplicity
in the Portuguese vernacular dialect, with a set of
dignified words and phrases approximating more nearly
to the latin. But the effect of the union is very imperfectly
appreciated by a foreigner; and the finest
charm of the expression is lost in the labour of studying a
poetic language of this kind. Besides the simplicity of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the composition does not exclude from Saa de Miranda’s
eclogues, those mysterious allusions to the romantic manners
of the age, which are so common in the writings
of the old Portuguese poets. The first eclogue which
he wrote in his native language, abounds in such allusions,
though it is in other respects one of the least
artificial of the poet’s productions in the class to which
it belongs. It is a pastoral dialogue in tercets concerning
love and indifference, happiness and unhappiness.
Three cantigas, the first in octaves, the second in
redondillas and in the Spanish language, and the third
in the syllabic measure of an Italian canzone, form the
poetic essence of this, simple composition. The disposition
to prefer the Spanish language for imagery, and
the Portuguese for reasoning, which is a striking feature
in Saa de Miranda’s poetry, plainly betrays itself in
this eclogue. The romantic conversation which forms
the frame work to the cantigas in this eclogue, consists
chiefly of general observations, which in the simple pastoral
language in which they are expressed, have a very
piquant character, but which are rendered scarcely intelligible
to a foreigner, by the occurrence of broken popular
phrases in a half ironical, half serious tone.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> To the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
philological obscurity of several passages is added the
enigmatical expression of suppressed pain, which, however,
is natural enough in the mouths of the persons to
whom it is assigned. In a word this eclogue is entirely
national. None but a Portuguese can justly estimate
its poetic merits and demerits. To a foreigner the cantigas
are decidedly the best portion.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>The second Portuguese eclogue, included in the
works of Saa de Miranda, has essentially the same tone
and character as the first; with this difference, that it is
versified throughout in national stanzas of ten lines
(<i>decimas</i>). Descriptions of the general instability and
transitory nature of earthly things are particularly conspicuous
in this as well as in several of Miranda’s other
poems.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> But it would be in vain to look in these Portuguese
eclogues for passages of such exquisite beauty
as those which occur in the Spanish eclogues of the
same author. It was only on the Castilian Parnassus
that Saa de Miranda established his fame as one of the
most distinguished of bucolic poets. With the exception
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
of elegant language and versification, his Portuguese
eclogues are not much superior to the cordial effusions
of Ribeyro.</p>

<p id="His_epistles_71">Saa de Miranda seems to have wished to display
his native language to advantage in another department
of composition, in which, however, he did not shine
with equal lustre. A series of poetic epistles which in
the collection of his works follow the pastoral poems,
are all, except one, written in Portuguese. At the
time of their appearance, no similar productions existed
in Portuguese literature: but they were speedily surpassed
by other writers. Nevertheless it is not merely
for the circumstance of their being first attempts that
they claim attention. They are distinguished from other
poems of this class by the delicate and characteristic
union of that peculiar style of pastoral poetry which
Miranda formed for his eclogues, with a didactic diction
which indicates the disciple of Horace. At the same
time Horatian ideas are but thinly scattered through
these epistles, and Miranda’s elegance of language is
far from reaching the force and precision of the latin
model. The poetry in which he endeavoured to approach
the style of Horace, is of the romantic didactic class&mdash;full
of sound morality, conveyed in ingenious reflections
and pleasing representations&mdash;full of truth and warmth
of feeling&mdash;but like all romantic poetry, it is somewhat
too prolix, and its learning like the most of that which
has passed through the scholastic conduits of the cloister,
is not drawn from a very profound source. To
interest by new views and ideas in didactic poetry, was
not a task suited to a catholic poet of the sixteenth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
century, and least of all to one who so piously adhered
to the principles of his faith as Saa de Miranda. The
most interesting ideas of this poet, in so far as the
value of such ideas is to be considered, must be estimated
by their truth and not by their novelty; and
their natural application to manners and characters
within the scope of the poet’s own observation, constitutes
the basis of their poetic merit. The verse
chiefly employed consists of light redondilhas, running
in stanzas of five lines; and thus, even in metrical
form, these epistles depart considerably from the style
of Horace. The two last, which, together with those
written in the Spanish language, are versified in tercets,
must in other respects be ranked in the same
class with the rest. Miranda, according to the old
custom, styles the whole series of these compositions
<i>Cartas</i> (letters), and not <i>Epistolas</i>, the term which at
a somewhat later period was properly, though not generally
employed by Portuguese writers, to designate
poems of a didactic or amusing description under the
form of individual correspondence. The first is addressed
to the king. After a long series of introductory
compliments, full of the accustomed phrases of servile
devotion to the throne, the author enters into popular
reflections on the art of government, and particularly
on the risk of deception, to which sovereigns of the
best intentions are constantly exposed. Some of these
reflections resolve very happily into practical traits of
didactic description.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> Miranda must be forgiven for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
his useless display of erudition which was quite in the
spirit of his age. In recompense, the legitimate character
of the poet predominates throughout the whole
composition. The succeeding epistles possess more of
the light ironical tone of Horace. They are addressed
to friends and acquaintances. They relate to the advantages
of rural life;&mdash;the equivocal nature of city
manners and amusements;&mdash;the mischievous effects of
luxury in Portugal since the introduction of the treasures
of India;&mdash;the value of literary occupation;&mdash;and
similar subjects, which an author, who had lived in the
gay world, and afterwards retired to solitude, might be
expected to discuss in pleasing verse. Thus from the
nature of their subjects Miranda’s epistles may also be
ranked among the literary pictures of manners in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
sixteenth century. The philanthropic and patriotic
poet particularly laments the insatiable spirit of trade
which prevailed in his native country. He declares his
opinion that danger was not to be apprehended from
the extended love of the arts and sciences, but from
the “perfumes of the Indian spices,” which had the
melancholy effect of enervating the old national character.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p id="His_spiritual_poems_74">Saa de Miranda also contributed to improve the
sacred poetry of his native country. His two hymns
to the Holy Virgin were the first compositions in Portuguese
literature which were executed entirely in the
style of the Italian canzone. They cannot, however,
be regarded as lyric master pieces any more than the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
spiritual canzoni of the Italians. Had a catholic poet
been able to guard himself against romantic prolixity
in such hymns, still must his fancy, on any attempt to
elevate it to the poetic spirit of the ode, have again been
subdued by the humiliating idea of the guilt and unworthiness
of man; and the more truly Christian the song
of praise might be, the more would it partake of the
litany character. Saa de Miranda cannot be regarded
as a model for the composition of hymns. But in his
two spiritual <i>Canções</i> he extended the sphere of Portuguese
lyric poetry by the noble diction which he introduced
into them.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> In the second <i>Cançaõ</i> he has,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
among other faults, indulged in a play on words, than
which no verbal conceit could be more antipoetic; for
he finds a wonderful analogy of contradiction between
the fall of womankind and the merits of the Holy
Virgin, in the name <i>Eve</i> and the word <i>Ave</i> with which
the angelical salutation commences.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> But these remains
of monkish quibbling are to be expected in spiritual,
and particularly in catholic spiritual poems of
the sixteenth century.</p>

<p id="His_popular_songs_76">In the series of Saa de Miranda’s lyric poems, there
are several popular songs written in some of the more
ancient forms of Portuguese poetry, which are, however,
dignified by purity of language and accuracy of
expression and versification. These songs are chiefly
of the style called cantigas, or poetic mottos, with
variation (<i>voltas</i>) which are shorter than the Spanish
<i>glossas</i>. They repeat the idea of the motto differently
turned or applied, but its text is not literally
interwoven with the variations; and this is precisely
the difference of form which distinguishes the older
Portuguese cantigas from the Spanish villancicos. To
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
these lyric compositions is added a beautiful elegy in
tercets, in which Miranda with manly dignity bewails
the death of his beloved son who accompanied King
Sebastian to Africa, and who fell in the same battle in
which that monarch lost his life.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>With Saa de Miranda the literary history of the
Portuguese drama likewise commences. Any attempts
at dramatic composition which may have been previously
made in the Portuguese language, obtained
no literary celebrity, and are now forgotten. That
in the time of Saa de Miranda, theatres existed in
Lisbon, in which dramas, similar to those in the Spanish
language were performed, is a fact sufficiently evident
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
from several allusions in Miranda’s two comedies, as
well as from the works of Gil Vicente, which will soon
claim particular notice. But no national taste for any
particular species of drama was then formed in Portugal.
The Castilian style could not give the tone to
the Portuguese; for at the period in question, which
was half a century previous to the birth of Lope de
Vega, the Spanish drama was still in its infancy and
wavering amidst heterogeneous forms. Thus the Portuguese
writers who turned their attention to dramatic
poetry, were not, in their choice of styles and forms,
restrained by any capricious conditions demanded by
the public. These circumstances afforded an opportunity
for commencing, without any literary warfare,
the improvement of the Portuguese drama by the
works of two poets, who like Saa de Miranda and
Gil Vicente trod in very different paths. Miranda
wrote two comedies in prose. They are dramas of
character in the style of Plautus and Terence:&mdash;one is
entitled <i>Os Estrangeiros</i> (the Foreigners); the other is
called <i>Os Vilhalpandos</i>, from two Spanish soldiers, who
had both adopted the name Vilhalpando, which, at that
period, was probably celebrated in the military world.
It has already been mentioned that the Infante Cardinal
Henry was particularly pleased with these two dramas,
that he permitted them to be performed at his court,
and that he gave orders for having them printed. How
they happened to obtain these honours is explained
partly by their own intrinsic merits and partly by contingent
and temporary circumstances. At the papal
court, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
favourable reception had been given to the early Italian
comedies in prose, and in particular to Bibiena’s <i>Calandra</i>.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>
Miranda’s taste had been formed in Italy,
and what pleased a pope might well afford entertainment
to a cardinal. Miranda, as a dramatic poet, retraced
the footsteps of Bibiena and Ariosto; and Cardinal
Henry of Portugal followed the example of
Leo X. It is, however, more than probable that the
Portuguese public was not induced by such high patronage
to manifest particular regard for this class of
dramatic entertainments, any more than the Italian
public had been, by the marks of distinction bestowed
on the plays of Bibiena and Ariosto.</p>

<p id="His_two_prose_comedies_78">The two comedies of Miranda are, nevertheless,
even at the present day, worthy the attention of the
critic. They are the first compositions of their kind in
Portuguese literature; and in none of the essentials of
the dramatic art are they surpassed by the subsequent
productions for which they have served as models. Both
dramas exhibit highly natural, though not ingenious delineations
of character, unaffected diction, and a pleasing
and rapid flow of dialogue; and though in their
composition they really possess but little dramatic merit,
still it is evident that a dramatic spirit has governed
their execution.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> These comedies are indeed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
imbued throughout with the delicate and refined spirit
of a poet, whose aversion from pedantry was equal to
his feeling of delicacy and love of nature. Miranda, as
a dramatist, endeavoured to draw common characters
from the life, after the manner of Plautus and Terence,
of whom he avowed himself an imitator,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> but he felt
the necessity of elevating, by some degree of refinement,
the vulgar phraseology which the characters he
chose to pourtray actually employed in common life.
For this purpose he availed himself of the interesting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
popular style in which he acquired such extraordinary
facility as an idyllic poet. Had the poetic spirit of
this popular style shone as conspicuously in his comedies
as in his pastoral poems, the former, like the latter, would
have been novel and single in their kind. But Saa de
Miranda was born a pastoral poet, and only made himself
a dramatist by imitation. If he had been penetrated
with the spirit of the comic dramatists of Rome, as he
was with that of the father of the Greek bucolic, he
would have endeavoured to become a Portuguese
Plautus or Terence in the same manner as he became
a Portuguese Theocritus. He would not then have
transplanted foreign manners to the comic stage of his
native land. Still less would he have imitated his
models in the manner of Bibiena; a manner which
even in Italy had been relinquished by Ariosto, who,
as a dramatist, struck into the same bypath, and missed
the goal. Miranda then did not, strictly speaking, follow
Plautus and Terence; but Bibiena and Ariosto, in their
character of imitators of those ancient poets, were his
guides in the region of dramatic poetry, where the
spirit of modern times demanded more than he was
capable of supplying. Besides, why did this poet, who
was a master in the art of versification, write his
dramas in prose? Wishing to adhere throughout to the
nature of prose, he makes the principal persons of his
dramas explain, chiefly in soliloquies, their own characters,
with a garrulity, which though certainly natural,
is nevertheless low and tedious; and the popular morality
which floats in this prolix stream of vulgar
phraseology affords no pleasurable compensation to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
auditor or reader.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> Faithful to his models, Miranda
has not, in either of his two comedies, laid the scene of
action in his native country, where he might have
dramatized national customs; the events which he
describes are supposed to take place in Italy, and the
manners, and in general the characters which he
paints, are Italian. In the selection of those characters,
he however follows Plautus and Terence, without
paying any apparent regard to the distinction
between different ages, by which the choice of the
dramatic poet ought to be directed. Of the principal
characters there is only one perfectly modern in the
<i>Estrangeiros</i>, and in like manner only one of the
same description appears in the <i>Vilhalpandos</i>. The
first is a pedantic doctor named <i>Juris</i>; the second is
a lady named <i>Fausta</i>, a hypocrite, surrounded by a
group of pretended devotees. The other characters in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
Miranda’s two dramas, besides valets and waiting maids,
are some old men, ostentatious soldiers, and enamoured
youths, a grumbling tutor, (<i>ayo,)</i> two or three merchants,
a parasite, (<i>truhaõ</i>,) a match-maker, (<i>casamenteiro</i>),
and others of a still baser description, which
the author seems to have thought could not be dispensed
with in any imitation of the ancient drama. In
the <i>Vilhalpandos</i> the author has also incidentally introduced
the modern characters of a hermit and a
French page. No remarkable intricacy of events is
produced by these characters being brought in contact
with each other; for Saa de Miranda was not formed to
be a writer of dramas of intrigue. His scenes are
strung together, rather than drawn out of each other.
It is not worth while more minutely to analyze the
composition of these two dramas. No highly comic
scenes occur in either of them. But their general
tone is spirited; and, if well performed, they doubtless
would, in the age in which they were produced, interest
an audience disposed to be pleased with the comic delineation
of character; for most of the scenes are of a
kind which might enable a player to supply by good
acting that comic force in which they are deficient.
Thus it happened that though the Portuguese public
took no particular interest in dramas of this class, no
party was formed, as in Italy, avowedly hostile to them.
The bitterest portion of the satire with which Miranda
invigorates, not the comic spirit, but the morality of his
dramas, is directed against the Italian and particularly
the Romish priesthood, to whose scandalous mode of
life, the basest characters are made, as the most proper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
witnesses in such a case, to bear ample testimony. It
appears, therefore, that at this time satire might be
openly and fearlessly directed against the clergy, and
that its application in that way was not displeasing to
the heads of the Portuguese church; for had it been
otherwise, so pious a writer as Saa de Miranda would
scarcely have ventured to indulge in such representations
even if he could have made them in secret.</p>

<p>Having taken a general view of the services which
this memorable writer rendered to Portuguese poetry,
it can scarcely be necessary to state that he was the
first classic poet of his nation; but if it be wished to
make a more rigid application of this title and to confer
it only on writers, whose poetic cultivation, according
to the classic models of the ancients, leaves nothing
farther to be desired, it were better to abstain altogether
from employing it in the history of modern
poetry. Miranda presented to his countrymen the first
example of the manner in which poetic genius aspiring
to the highest pinnacle of art, ought to study the
classic poets of antiquity, in order to acquire clearness
of poetic perception, solid judgment in invention and
precision, elegance and ingenious simplicity in composition
and diction, without renouncing his individual
character and the genius of his age and nation.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>The account of the classic school which Saa de
Miranda founded in Portuguese poetry, must be deferred
until historical justice be rendered to the genius of a
less cultivated poet, who flourished at the same period
with Saa de Miranda, but who chose for himself a
totally different path on the Portuguese Parnassus.</p>


<h3 id="Gil_Vicente_85">GIL VICENTE.</h3>

<p>Writers on literature have not recorded the date of
the birth of Gil Vicente, who is styled the Portuguese
Plautus.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> There is reason to suppose that at the latest
he was born within twenty years of the close of the
fifteenth century. It is known that he belonged to a
family of rank, and that he studied the law in compliance
with the wish of his family. But it appears
that he speedily relinquished his juridical studies and
devoted himself wholly to the dramatic art. It is not
recorded whether or not he was regularly pensioned as
a writer to the court; but he was most indefatigable in
furnishing the royal family and the public with dramatic
entertainments suited to the taste of the age.
He constantly resided at court, where his poetic talents
were held in permanent requisition for the celebration of
spiritual as well as temporal festivals; and no dramatic
writer in Europe was more admired and esteemed than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
Gil Vicente. His first productions were performed with
approbation at court in the reign of Emanuel the Great;
but his reputation acquired additional brilliancy in the
reign of John III. a monarch who, as has already been
mentioned, did not scruple in his younger years to
perform characters in the dramas of this favourite
author. Vicente seems also to have possessed all the
requisite qualifications for a theatrical manager. We
are not informed whether he was himself an actor;
but he was the tutor of the most distinguished actress
of his age, namely, his daughter <i>Paula</i>, maid
of honour to the Infanta Maria, a poetess, an amateur
performer on several instruments, and, as it
appears, celebrated for every thing except beauty.
Erasmus is said to have learned Portuguese for the
express purpose of reading the comedies of Vicente
in the original. There are no notices extant by
which farther insight into the personal character of
this poet could be obtained. He died in the year 1557
at Evora, and, as there is reason to believe, at an advanced
age. Five years after his death, his son Luis
Vicente edited a complete collection of his works, or at
least of all that had been preserved in manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p id="General_character_of_his_dramatic_prose_87">Gil Vicente would have been the Portuguese Lope
de Vega, if not something even superior, had he been
born half a century later, and had he been as much
indebted to his age as the Spanish dramatist was to
that in which he flourished. But no one was less calculated
than Gil Vicente to become an improver of
taste; and indeed he was far from being ambitious of
earning that honourable title. Had not the favour of
the public been continued to him and his dramas even
after the middle of the sixteenth century, when the
school of Saa de Miranda had risen and acquired the
ascendancy in the polite world, he might with propriety
be ranked as the last in the series of the Portuguese
poets of the fifteenth century. His diction, as well as
his whole poetic style, belongs to that age, and to the
latest period of his life he continued faithful to the old
national manner. In the conflict with the new style
introduced by Saa de Miranda’s school, Gil Vicente
appeared as the representative of the yet enduring
national taste, which even at court, where the adherents
of the new party were most honourably distinguished,
preserved a co-equal authority with that party. That
each party should under such circumstances maintain
its credit is not a little remarkable. Perhaps they
became accommodated to each other merely because the
Portuguese had no relish for literary feuds. It may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
presumed that each party therefore felt itself secure,
and, content with its own security, took no notice of the
other.</p>

<p>Here we again arrive at the point, at which the
historian of the cultivation of the Portuguese and
Spanish drama finds a stumbling-block in the way of
his enquiries; for the materials necessary to the right
prosecution of his labour are either entirely wanting or
involved in contradiction. In the history of the Spanish
theatre it has already been stated how little positive
knowledge the Spaniards possessed even in the age of
Cervantes and Lope de Vega, respecting the early formation
of their national comedy.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> To Torres Naharro,
so strangely overlooked by Cervantes, the honour of
being the real father of the Spanish comedy, must,
on every just principle of historical criticism, be conceded.
But Gil Vicente was a contemporary of
Torres Naharro; and the dramatic compositions of
the Portuguese poet, so far approximate to the ruder
forms of the Spanish comedy, as to entitle Portuguese
writers to claim for their own country the honour of
the invention of that comedy. Spanish Autos either
did not exist in the beginning of the sixteenth century,
or if they did, they have disappeared from the domain
of literature. A whole series of Autos by Gil Vicente
are, however, extant; and several were written within
the first ten years of the sixteenth century. Some are
entirely in the Spanish language; others are half in
Portuguese and half in Spanish, but all present, in
their radical features, the form and character of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Spanish spiritual comedy. Was Gil Vicente then the
first writer who exhibited a kind of poetic design in
dramatic entertainments for the celebration of christian
festivals, and thus raised to literary consideration a style
of composition which had previously been degraded by
monks and buffoons? Or are the corresponding works
of contemporary Spanish writers lost in oblivion? Was
Gil Vicente an imitator of Torres Naharro, or did the
latter copy from the former?</p>

<p>The number of dramas which Gil Vicente has
bequeathed to posterity is considerable, though compared
with the fertility of some of the Spanish poets,
by no means extraordinary. They are arranged in
classes either by himself, or, as is more probable, by his
son, by whom they were published; and in taking a
critical view of them this classification is very convenient.
At the commencement appear the Autos or spiritual
dramas; next follow some anomalous works, which
are oddly enough, in preference to all others, styled
comedies; these are succeeded by the tragi-comedies;
and last of all come the <i>Farsas</i>. Various small
poems in the Spanish and Portuguese languages form
an appendix to the collection. These works display a
true poetic spirit, which, however, accommodated itself
entirely to the age of the poet, and which disdained all
cultivation. The dramatic genius of Gil Vicente is equally
manifest from his power of invention, and from the natural
turn and facility of his imitative talent. Even the
rudest of these dramas is tinged with a certain degree of
poetic feeling. Scenes in stanzas and redondilhas which,
though harmonious, are of antiquated construction,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
succeed each other with wonderful truth and simplicity.
But there appears in these compositions no perception
of what may be properly called the perfection of dramatic
poetry; and no trace of an endeavour to attain
classic excellence, calls to mind the spirit of the sixteenth
century. Gil Vicente’s language, too, is altogether
in the old and uncultivated style.</p>

<p id="His_autos_or_spiritual_dramas_90">The <i>Autos</i>, or spiritual dramas, contained in the
collected works of this poet, are sixteen in number.
They cannot properly be called <i>Corpus Christi</i> pieces,
or <i>Autos Sacramentales</i>; for most of them were written
to be performed on Christmas night, in celebration of
that festival, either before the court at Lisbon, or at
royal residences in the country, and they perfectly correspond
with the object for which they were intended.
Pastoral poetry forms the basis of the whole, even of
those which, taking a totally different turn from the
rest, become alternately didactic and allegoric. By
this characteristic feature they are distinguished from
most of the Autos of Spanish or posterior origin.
Accident favoured the national poetic genius of the
Portuguese in the creation of the spiritual pastoral
drama. Gil Vicente while yet a youth and a tyro in
the poetic art, surprised King Emanuel and the Queen
on the birth of the Infante, afterwards King John III.
by the production of a little pastoral drama, which appears
better adapted for celebrating the festival of
Christmas than the birth of a hereditary prince, but
which was, perhaps, on that very account the more
flattering to the royal family. This pastoral drama is,
in consequence of the distinction it thus obtained,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
placed before Vicente’s Autos, and a notice by the son
of the poet explains the reason why that precedence is
assigned to it. The little piece is written in the Spanish
language. Vicente’s son observes in his notice, that it
was received with particular favour because it was
something new in Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> It is therefore probable
that at this period Gil Vicente, as yet unconscious of
his own talent, only followed in the footsteps of the
venerable Juan del Enzina.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Having at the request
of the royal family altered his piece in such a way as
to render it more suitable to representation at Christmas,
he was thus accidentally directed into the path which naturally
led to the union of dramatic poetry with christian
mysteries, and which he afterwards steadily explored.
Year after year with increasing taste and fancy he continued
to write Christmas pieces, which at last assumed
a more enlarged form. Among the personages introduced
in these dramas there are always some of the
pastoral class, intended to represent directly, and also
in a certain degree allegorically, the shepherds at the
manger of Bethlehem. But the inventive poet soon
advanced a step further. He composed dramas in the
same style for the celebration of other religious festivals,
without any admixture of pastoral poetry. Among his
Autos, however, there is one in celebration of the
festival of Corpus Christi, which was one of his earliest
productions. The notice annexed to it states that it
was performed in the year 1504. It is founded on a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
simple incident in the life of St. Martin, and possesses
scarcely any thing of the character of the later spiritual
dramas, or <i>Autos Sacramentales</i>, properly so called.
But a far greater display of fancy and theatrical splendour,
was the result of Gil Vicente’s subsequent endeavours
to dramatize the mysteries of the catholic
faith. It would appear that spiritual dramas of this
class, in which so much was to be seen and admired,
had never before been produced either on the Portuguese
or the Spanish stage. It cannot, therefore, be
doubted, that Gil Vicente’s Autos had their effect on
the Spanish dramatists of the sixteenth century; and
that if they were not imitated as models, they served at
least as examples for emulation.</p>

<p>The invention and the execution of Gil Vicente’s
Autos present an equal degree of rudeness. The least
artificial are also those in which the most decided traits
of national character appear. The shepherds and
shepherdesses who are introduced into these Autos are
Portuguese and Spanish both in their names and manners.
Their simple phrases and turns of language are
similar to those employed by the characters in Saa de
Miranda’s eclogues, except that their discourse is more
negligent and occasionally more coarse. In combining
the appearance of angels, the devil, the holy virgin and
allegorical characters, with popular scenes, an effect
perfectly consistent with the ideas of the audience was
produced; for, according to the catholic doctrine, the
miracles with which Christianity commenced are continued
without intermission; through the mysteries of
faith, the connection between the terrestrial, celestial
and infernal worlds is declared; and by allegory that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
connection is rendered perceptible. The critic would
therefore judge very unfairly, were he to regard as
proofs of bad taste the consequences which a poet
naturally entails on himself in writing according to the
spirit of his religion. Making allowance, however, for
that spirit, the rudeness of Gil Vicente’s Autos must be
acknowledged even by him who measuring them by the
rule of critical judgment, is perfectly disposed to view
every system of religion only on its poetic side. For
instance in one of the simplest of these Autos some shepherds
who discourse in Spanish, enter a chapel, which
is decorated with all the apparatus necessary for the
celebration of the festival of Christmas. The shepherds
cannot sufficiently express their rustic admiration of the
pomp exhibited in the chapel. Faith (<i>La Fè</i>) enters as
an allegorical character. She speaks Portuguese, and
after announcing herself to the shepherds as true Faith,
she explains to them the nature of faith, and enters
into an historical relation of the mysteries of the incarnation.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
This is the whole subject of the piece.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Another Auto in which the poet’s fancy has taken a
wider range, presents scenes of a more varied nature.
Mercury enters as an allegorical character, and as the
representative of the planet which bears his name. He
explains the theory of the planetary system and the Zodiac,
and cites astronomical facts from Regiomontanus,
in a long series of stanzas in the old national style. A Seraph
then appears who is sent down from heaven by God
in compliance with the prayers of Time. The Seraph, in
the quality of a herald, proclaims a large yearly fair in
honour of the Holy Virgin, and invites customers to
it.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> A Devil next makes his appearance with a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
stall which he carries before him. He gets into a dispute
with Time and the Seraph, and asserts that among
men such as they are, he shall be sure to find purchasers
for his wares.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> He therefore leaves to every customer
his free choice. Mercury then summons eternal Rome
as the representative of the church. She appears, and
offers for sale peace of mind, as the most precious of
her merchandize. The Devil remonstrates; and Rome
retires. Two Portuguese peasants now appear in the
market. One is very anxious to sell his wife, and observes
that if he cannot sell her, he will give her away
for nothing, as she is a wicked spendthrift. Amidst
this kind of conversation a party of peasant women
enter, one of whom, with considerable comic warmth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
vents bitter complaints against her husband.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> The
man who has already been inveighing against his wife
immediately recognizes her, and says:&mdash;“that is my
slippery helpmate.”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> During this succession of comic
scenes the action does not advance. The Devil at last
opens his little stall and displays his stock of goods to
the female peasants; but one of them who is the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
pious of the party seems to suspect that all is not quite
right with regard to the merchandize, and she exclaims:
“Jesus! Jesus! True God and man!” The Devil immediately
takes to flight, and does not re-appear; but
the Seraph again comes forward and mingles with the
rustic groupes. The throng continues to increase; other
countrywomen with baskets on their heads arrive; and
the market is stored with vegetables, poultry and other
articles of rural produce. The Seraph offers virtues for
sale; but they find no purchasers. The peasant girls
observe that in their village money is more sought after
than virtue, when a young man wants a wife. One of
the party, however, says, that she wished to come to the
market because it happened to fall on the festival of the
mother of God; and because the Virgin does not sell
her gifts of grace (<i>as graças</i>); but she distributes them
gratis (<i>de graça</i>). This observation crowns the theological
morality of the piece, which terminates with a
hymn of praise, in the popular style, in honour of the
Holy Virgin.</p>

<p>These specimens will afford an adequate idea of the
spirit and style of Gil Vicente’s Autos. His largest
work of this class may, however, be referred to, in proof
of the little attention he bestowed on dramatic plan in
the composition of his spiritual comedies. It purports
to be “A Summary of the History of God.” After the
prologue, which is spoken by an Angel, Sir Lucifer
(<i>Senhor Lucifer</i>,) enters, attended by a numerous retinue
of devils. Belial is president of his court of
justice (<i>meirinho de corte</i>), and Satan gentleman of his
privy council, (<i>fidalgo do conselho</i>). After this privy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
counsellor has performed his part in the temptation of
Adam and Eve in Paradise, the whole details of which
are represented on the stage, Lucifer confers on him the
dignities of duke and captain of the kingdoms of the
world.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> Next succeeds a series of scenes which summarily
represent the history of the christian redemption.
The World accompanied by Time and angels enters as a
king. The representation of the fall of man is followed
by the history of Abel, by whom a beautiful and simple
hymn is sung.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> The next scenes exhibit the histories of
Abraham, Job, and David; and thus the Auto proceeds
through the incidents of the old and new testaments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
until the ascension of Christ, which is represented on the
stage amidst an accompaniment of drums and trumpets.</p>

<p>On comparing the Autos of Gil Vicente with those
of Calderon, the difference appears not much less considerable
than that which exists between the works of
Hans Sachs and Shakespeare. But the graceful simplicity
with which many of the scenes of these spiritual
dramas are executed, raises the Portuguese poet infinitely
above the poetic shoe-maker of Nuremberg.</p>

<p id="His_comedies_99">The most unimportant of the dramatic works of
Gil Vicente are those which the poet and his son have
called comedies. One is a dramatized novel, in which a
young lady, whom her lover, a priest, has seduced, appears
on the stage in child-bed, and after long lamentations
and discussions is actually delivered of a daughter.
In the second half of the piece the child whose birth is
thus announced has attained the age of womanhood,
and is in her turn introduced as a lady loving and
beloved. The action, however, is not destitute of interest.
In the first half of the drama, a Witch, who
summons the Devil on the stage, assists the unfortunate
lady in child-bed, and afterwards, five laundresses
(<i>lavandeiras</i>) make their appearance. Nevertheless,
amidst much extravagance and absurdity, the author has
represented several scenes of domestic life, in a style
equally pleasing and natural. No example of the intrigue
of the Spanish theatre is to be found in this
piece, but there is introduced a fool (<i>parvo</i>), or more
properly a waggish clown, a character which appears
to be the rude prototype of the Spanish <i>gracioso</i>.
Pleasing songs in the Spanish language are interspersed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
through the dialogue. The young girl who was born
at the commencement of the piece takes leave of the
public in the character of a princess. Several of Gil
Vicente’s other works, which are styled comedies, are
dramatized novels, similar to that just described. One
which is entitled, <i>A Floresta de Enganos</i>, (the Forest
or Gardens of Deception),<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> is merely a dramatized
garland of sprightly fancies enriched with allegorical
and mythological ornaments. At the head of the
dramatis personæ appears the burlesque character of a
philosopher, who, because he has reproved some wicked
men for their misconduct, is, by way of punishment,
tied to a fool (<i>parvo</i>) with whom he is thus compelled
to associate. He regards this punishment as the severest
torture that could be inflicted on a philosopher. He
speaks Spanish, and the replies of the fool are more
remarkable for their rudeness than for their wit.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p id="His_tragi_comedies_101">Gil Vicente’s tragi-comedies may be regarded as
rough outlines of that kind of drama which subsequently
formed a variety of the heroic comedies<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> of the Spanish
stage. They are not historical dramas, but festival
pieces adorned with a certain pomp of allegory, mythology,
magic, &amp;c. and occasionally interspersed with
pathetic scenes. They were performed before the court
on festivals or particular occasions, which are specified.
One of these dramas, entitled, <i>Amadis de Gaula</i>, and
founded on some of the incidents in the celebrated
romance of the same name, was, in spite of its inoffensive
character, forbidden to be performed in Spain
in the reign of Philip II. The cause of this prohibition
probably was, that the disguise of Amadis, as a pilgrim,
was deemed a profanation of the sacred habit. This
piece which is written in the Spanish language, is destitute
of all merit of invention. Others of these dramas
exhibit more traces of the poet’s fancy; but in none is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
there the foundation of a genuine dramatic plot. One
entitled, <i>Exhortaçaõ de Guerra</i>, (Exhortation to War),
was doubtless a favourite with the court. A pious
magician appears who has learned necromancy in a
sybil’s cave. By powerful spells he summons to his presence
some subject demons, whom he suffers to revile
him in the coarsest language.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> He however obliges
them to conjure up the spirits of Polyxena, Penthesilea,
Achilles, Scipio, and other celebrated characters of antiquity.
These spirits appear in succession, and address
fine compliments to the royal family. In another tragi-comedy
Providence is introduced as a Princess. But
the most varied of all is <i>Triumpho do Invierno</i>, (Winter’s
Triumph), in two parts. Besides a multitude of
characters, among which an allegorical personification of
Winter is one of the most conspicuous, Gil Vicente exhibited
to his audience a view of the open sea, agitated
by a storm during the most inclement season of the
year. The noise and confusion among the ships in
distress, and the oaths and prayers of the Portuguese
sailors expressed in rhymes and redondilhas, would
naturally be gratifying to a public who at the period
when the piece was written, took particular interest
in maritime affairs.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> Another of these tragi-comedies
is also a satire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p id="His_farces_103">Gil Vicente was destined by nature to be a comic
poet. His <i>farças</i> (farces) are by far his best productions;
and to them he was indebted for the chief portion
of his fame, as well as for the honourable but ill-chosen
surname which some critics have applied to him.
If the literary relationship between two dramatic writers
were to be decided by the comic strength of their
works, then indeed Gil Vicente might be truly termed
a second Plautus. But neither in respect to their form
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
nor their spirit can Vicente’s farces be ranked in the
same class with the regular comedies of Plautus. Nevertheless
the name of <i>farces</i>, was not given to those comic
dramas, on account of their irregularity or their burlesque
style. At the rise of the modern theatre in Spain
and Portugal all dramas were denominated farces,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> and
that the name has been continued to be applied to Vicente’s
comedies, is an accident arising merely from the
want of a better term of classification. It is in like
manner the result of accident, that in France, England
and Germany, the same term is still employed to distinguish
precisely that species of drama to which Gil Vicente’s
farces belong. These pieces are equally burlesque
in their design and execution. They may, in a certain
sense, be styled dramas of character; for Vicente attached
great importance to the burlesque representation of some
characters which he sketched from life. But he never
thought of founding his comic interest on plot and intrigue;
and in the degree of cultivation to which he had
attained, and above which he never rose, he was incapable
of designing and executing, on a comprehensive scale,
a dramatic picture of character with true delicacy of outline,
and still less with interesting truth of colouring. His
farces, like his other dramas, have no regular plot for
their ground-work. They are dramatic conceptions of
scenes of real life, rapidly sketched by a glowing fancy,
with genuine comic feeling, with a certain poetic keeping,
even when derived from the commonest nature, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
worked up by more or less of plastic talent, into some
form, but without any regard to correctness, and altogether
executed as a mere sportive task. In these farces
the language and metrical form are the same as in Gil
Vicente’s other dramas. The alternation of the Portuguese
and Castilian idioms is seldom governed by any
other rule than the caprice of the poet. Upon the
whole Gil Vicente’s farces bear much resemblance to
the <i>Entremeses</i> which subsequently became favourite
entertainments on the Spanish stage; like them they
are not divided either into acts or scenes.</p>

<p>Among the eleven dramas, which in the collected
works of Gil Vicente are entitled farces, there are two
festival pieces, in the popular style, which might with
equal propriety have been ranged in one of the preceding
classes. The first piece is truly a farce. Two
miserable servants, the one a Portuguese, the other a
Spaniard, who are almost starving in the service of two
coxcombs, meet together in the street at midnight, and
each in his respective language complains of his sad
fate. The Portuguese describes his master as an enamoured
enthusiast, who employs himself day and night
in writing silly verses, and in singing them to his own
wretched music, but who never appears to think of eating
and drinking.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> This romantic gentleman (<i>escudeiro</i>)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
soon makes his appearance with one of his own song
books in his hand. Before he begins to sing a song,
he reads aloud its title, and names himself as the author.
When he has finished it he commences a new song,
first pronouncing very formally the words, “Another
by the same,” in the style of the old Cancioneiros. He
proceeds to sing under the window of his mistress Isabella,
a miller’s coquetish daughter, where his music is
accompanied by the barking of dogs and the mewing of
cats. The blending of these songs, which though insipid,
possess something of the tender and melancholy character
of the old cantigas, with the conversation of the lover
and his servant,&mdash;with the whisperings of the serenaded
Isabella from her lattice window,&mdash;and with the rage of
the gallant at the dogs and cats, which mortify him by
the interruption of his singing, was doubtless calculated
to operate very powerfully on the risibility of the audience,
though much of the ludicrous effect of the scene
must now be supplied by the imagination of the reader.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
The mother of Isabella at length appears, with a lantern
in her hand, endeavouring to learn what is the
cause of the uproar. Here a change of scene commences
with the lamentations of the old woman in a
burlesque caricature style.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> She enters into a dispute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
first with her coquetish daughter, who has expressed
herself pleased with the serenade, and then with the
gallant, who at length sings a farewell stanza, and departs.
But this collection of songs and dialogues is as
far from having any real dramatic object as are the
other farces of Vicente, in which he sometimes introduces
Witches,&mdash;at that period objects of particular
interest with the public,&mdash;performing incantations in
concert with the Devil; sometimes Frenchmen and Italians
who speak a kind of broken Portuguese, perhaps
often enough heard on the quays of Lisbon. In another
of these lively entertaining dramas, an enamoured
old man is the principal character.</p>

<p>Of all these farces, however, that entitled <i>Inez
Pereira</i>, is distinguished by the most remarkable plot
and the greatest stretch of dramatic talent. The history
of this piece serves to throw some light on the
relation in which Gil Vicente stood with respect to the
Portuguese public. Some persons, it appears, had
expressed doubts of his title to the authorship of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
admired farces attributed to him, and in order to maintain
the reputation of his talent, he was desirous
that a pointed theme should be prescribed to him as
a ground-work for dramatic composition. It was accordingly
suggested that he would find a fit subject
in the Portuguese proverb: “I prefer an ass that carries
me, to a horse that throws me.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> For the comic
representation of this proverb, Vicente chose the prettily
conceived story of a young girl, who rejects the
matrimonial offer of a wealthy simpleton, because she
is resolved to marry none but a man of superior understanding
and talents. Inez at length finds a man after
her own heart. She gives him her hand, but soon grows
very unhappy, because she finds that with such a husband,
his will must always be her law. She now sincerely
repents the coyness with which she had listened
to the proposals of her less gifted lover. Death soon
interposes in her favour, and she becomes a widow.
Her former suitor offers himself again, and Inez triumphs
in the possession of a husband whom she finds
it easy to manage. This happily chosen fable is worked
up with more care than Vicente seems to have bestowed
on his other farces. Had this poet been placed in circumstances
similar to those which a hundred and fifty
years later operated in favour of Moliere, <i>Inez Pereira</i>
would in all probability have been made one of the best
comic pieces of character in the dramatic literature of
modern times. But in this drama Gil Vicente has contented
himself with grouping his characters in a brilliant
but confused throng, stringing his scenes together like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
a wreath of roses, exhibiting events, between which,
days, weeks, and months intervene, in immediate succession,
like pictures in a rareeshow; and thus upon
the whole he has made little approximation towards
the point of cultivated taste.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> But this farce supplies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
illustrations of the manners of the age, which could
not easily be obtained from any other source.&mdash;We
learn from it that the jews in Lisbon were then
particularly celebrated as marriage brokers (<i>casamenteiros</i>)
and that they carried on this employment as an
ordinary branch of traffic. One of the suitors is introduced
by some jews of this profession to Inez
Pereira.</p>

<p>On reverting from the dramas of Gil Vicente to the
poetic works of the classic writers, at whose head Saa
de Miranda stands, the reader will find himself transported
to a totally different world. But this transition
belongs to the chronological order of the subject.</p>


<h3 id="Ferreira_111">FERREIRA.</h3>

<p>Antonio Ferreira, surnamed the Portuguese Horace,
was born at Lisbon in the year 1528. His parents, who
belonged to the first class of nobility, destined him for
a statesman or public functionary. He obtained the
degree of Doctor at the University of Coimbra, where
he studied the civil law. He took however less interest
in his jurisprudential studies than in the lectures of a
professor of ancient literature, named Diogo de Tieve,
who at that time possessed great celebrity, and for
whom after quitting the university he continued to
entertain a strong affection and regard. While Ferreira
was pursuing his studies at Coimbra, the works
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
of Horace, and other poets of antiquity, produced on
him an impression totally different from that which
was experienced by the other students, who directed
their attention to ancient literature. Among the latter
it was a fashion to write verses in latin, and to look
with disdain on the Portuguese language; but Ferreira,
while yet a youth, proved himself an enthusiastic lover
of his mother tongue. He resolved not to write a line
in any foreign language, not even in Spanish; and he
faithfully kept his determination. In his beautiful introductory
or dedicatory stanza, to readers after his
own taste (<i>a os bons engenhos</i>) he intimates that his
poems shall belong “to those readers to whose pure
bosoms he may commit them. For himself he will be
content with the glory of having it said that he loved
his native land and his countrymen.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> But the patriotic
spirit which thus glowed in the soul of Ferreira
was combined, in a manner then altogether uncommon,
with a similar enthusiasm for the ancient classics, and
particularly for the poetry of Horace. The example
of Saa de Miranda had also its influence in forming his
taste; and he closely studied the Italian poets from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
whom he learned to combine classic correctness of ideas
and language, on the model of the ancients, with a
natural poetic style, suited to the age in which he
lived. The beautiful structure of Italian verse so
charmed him, that he thought no other metres possessed
sufficient dignity to entitle them to be introduced
into Portuguese poetry. He accordingly never composed
in redondilhas, and, generally speaking, in no
verse in the old national style. The whole object of
his ambition was to be a classical poet, and in that
character to give to Portuguese poetry a new, and
according to his taste, a more noble diction. Inspired
with the hope of accomplishing this purpose, he laboured
with so much assiduity, that before he left the university
he had composed the greater portion of the
hundred and thirteen sonnets which are contained in
the collection of his poems. Whether the “Lady
of his Thoughts,” who supplies in these sonnets the
place of Petrarch’s Laura, was no imaginary character,
is uncertain. It cannot, however, be doubted,
that in his fifth elegy the poet alludes to a real and
beloved Manila, who had been snatched from him by
death. Ferreira was twenty-nine years of age when
he published the first collection of his poetic works.
He had previously been engaged in delivering academic
lectures, probably on jurisprudence, in the university of
Coimbra. In his poetic pursuits, he was joined by
several young men of similar talent, particularly Andrade
Caminha, Jeronymo Cortereal, and Diogo Bernardes,
who, together with other poets of that age,
formed a circle of disciples and admirers of Saa de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Miranda. But he grew tired of his university studies,
and visited the court where he soon acquired distinction.
He obtained the high office of <i>desembargador de camara
de supplicaçaõ</i> (judge of the council of grace),
and he was likewise appointed a <i>fidalgo da casa real</i>
(gentleman of the royal household). For the young
poets of Portugal he now became an oracle of criticism;
and a most brilliant prospect had opened itself
to him, when in the year 1569, and at the age of
forty-one, he died of the plague which was supposed
to be brought to Lisbon from the Levant. A monument
was erected to his memory in the church where he was
buried; but the stone is now much defaced.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p id="General_character_of_his_poetry_114">Though not a poet of the first rank, Ferreira has,
as a classical poet, been surpassed by no other in Portuguese
literature, and has in that respect also had but
few equals in the literature of Spain. His fancy was
circumscribed, and to originality he seems to have
put forth no pretension; but the sound taste which he
manifested from the commencement of his poetic cultivation,
was a thing totally new in Portugal at that
period. Ferreira was by no means a blind or pedantic
imitator of the ancients and the Italians. He was, however,
animated by an enthusiastic feeling for every thing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
truly exemplary in the writings of the foreign poets
whom he chose for prototypes; his vigorous understanding,
cherished with particular predilection the idea of
reforming the national Portuguese poetry after such
models; and patriotic zeal prompted him to complete
what poetic feeling and sound judgment had combined
to suggest. Correctness of ideas as well as of language
was to him the first requisite of all poetic
beauty. He wished to banish from the poetry of his
native land those traces of orientalism which it still
retained. It was not less his study to avoid the eccentric
than the common. He attached more importance
to noble than to extraordinary ideas. But to poetic
energy, precision and plenitude of picturesque expression,
or what may be termed the poetry of language,
his attention was chiefly directed. This quality he cultivated
with a degree of talent and judgment, which
would have imparted to his style Horatian perfection,
were it not for the philosophic laconism peculiar to the
diction of Horace, and which no modern poet, Klopstock
alone excepted, has been able to approach. Ferreira was
the first Portuguese writer who manifested a particular
interest in the poetic dignity of his native tongue. He
was the first who practically proved that the soft toned
accentuation and simple popular idiom of that language
were not inconsistent either with the energetic
expression of didactic poetry, or the sonorous rhythm
of the loftier styles. In this respect he essentially departed
from the manner of Saa de Miranda; and thus
his poetry lost the national colouring by which that
of his predecessor is peculiarly distinguished. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
works of Ferreira belong indeed to that class of
Portuguese poetry which is most easily intelligible to a
foreigner possessing a knowledge of latin. Ferreira’s latinity
of expression extends even to metrical scanning
in which he assumed new freedoms;<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> and the title
under which he published his poems, and which they
still retain, has a sort of latin air.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> Ferreira has
therefore never been a favourite poet with the great
mass of the Portuguese public. There was indeed a
time during the seventeenth century in which he was
despised even by the polite world as a learned pedant;<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
but a later posterity has rendered justice to his merits.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Precisely such a poet as Ferreira was wanting to
create among the Portuguese that taste for sound
good sense in poetry, which they but too soon lost,
and which, in these latter times, they have tardily
endeavoured to recover. Ferreira himself takes various
opportunities of explaining the principles by which he
was guided in the composition of his works. In an
epistle to Diogo Bernardes, he says&mdash;his first rule is to
be as distrustful of himself as he is of superficial
censurers; to follow his natural feelings, and to avoid a
forced use of art; to respect only the judgment of those
who are capable of judging; to follow the counsel of
well informed and sincere friends; and to polish the
rudeness of genius by industry and judicious imitation.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p id="His_correct_style_of_sonnet_composition_117">Ferreira’s sonnets which amount to a considerable
number, are divided into two books. They were all,
as has already been remarked, written by the poet at
an early period of life. The study of the Petrarchian
sonnet is every where manifest in those attempts to
emulate the pure Italian style, which, though imitations,
are free of all traces of effort and affectation. In
general, however, Ferreira’s tender complaints exhibit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
only feeble glimmerings of the intensity and grace of
Petrarch; but on the other hand they are disfigured
by fewer extravagancies than the similar effusions of
passion by other Portuguese and Spanish poets; and
the energy of the expression is usually ennobled by
classic grace of diction. Some of these amatory
sonnets may be regarded as models.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> In others,
however, the poet speaks of “burning snow and
freezing fire.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Among the best are some which occur
in the second book, in which the poet laments the death
of his mistress.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> Ferreira seems to have felt no inclination
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
to imitate Petrarch’s didactic sonnets probably, because
he had at an early period given to his didactic poetry a
different form, and one which bore a more decided resemblance
to his favourite Horace.</p>

<p id="His_odes_119">In the composition of odes Ferreira unquestionably
endeavoured to form his style on the model of Horace.
But among the thirteen poems, which in the collection of
Ferreira’s works are ranged under the title of <i>Odas</i>, and
which notwithstanding their scanty number are divided
into two books, there is not one which exhibits a truly
lyric flight of fancy. In all the language is excellent;
the sentiment noble; and the didactic tone and the
dignity of the whole manner are in admirable unison
with the sonorous melody of the metre; but no new and
energetic ideas, no lyric boldness, which, at first sight,
might seem irregularity, surprise and charm the reader.
Ferreira indeed expressly proposed to himself to soar
even as a writer of odes above “the ignorant multitude;”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>
but by his frequent repetition of certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
pompous and sonorous phrases, he widely departs from
the character of the Horatian style.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> Even the moral
energy of sentiment which appears in Ferreira’s odes, is
not the energy of Horace.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> It would appear that the
Italian canzoni with their superfluity of beautiful
words and phrases had influenced Ferreira to an extent
of which he was unconscious. Some of his odes have
precisely the metrical form of the canzone, with the
exception of the concluding flourish or apostrophe of
the poet to his poem. Others have shorter stanzas like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
those of the Spanish odes of Luis de Leon.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> Is
possible that Ferreira may have been acted upon by
the example of Luis de Leon, as they were contemporaries
and almost of equal age; or, perhaps, the
Spaniard was influenced by the Portuguese poet. This,
however, is a subject to which writers of neither
country make allusion; but it is certain that the
character of Ferreira had nothing in common with the
tranquil yet captivating enthusiasm of Luis de Leon.
Nevertheless in the composition of the ode he became a
model for the poets of his own nation, as Luis de Leon
was for those of Spain; and every poem to which the
title of ode has subsequently been given in Portuguese
literature, exhibits nearly the same character and
metrical form of which he set the example. In Ferreira’s
odes the descriptive passages are usually the
best.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p id="His_elegies_122">The elegies of Ferreira, at the period at which they
were written, had also the advantage of the charm of
novelty in the literature of his country; for with the
exception of the single elegy of Saa de Miranda no
poem of that class existed in the Portuguese language.
Ariosto seems to have been the model whom Ferreira
particularly copied in elegiac composition. Like Ariosto,
he very happily seized the idea of the pleasing voluptuous
elegy of the ancients, which was soon after neglected
and continued long lost to modern literature. His elegy
on May is a classic masterpiece.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> He was less successful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
in plaintive elegy. Among the elegies of this kind
which he composed, several deserve only to be regarded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
as occasional poems on the death of distinguished
persons. Others are properly epistles, abounding in
moral reflexions and observations on the uncertainty of
human affairs, but wanting in that tone of tender
melancholy which is essential to the true plaintive
elegy.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> A few free translations from the Greek of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
Moschus and Anacreon are annexed to this collection
of elegies.</p>

<p id="His_eclogues_125">Ferreira’s eclogues possess little poetic merit; and,
excellent as is the diction, the style is not sufficiently
bucolick. Ferreira was no less susceptible than Saa de
Miranda of the philosophic enjoyment of a country life
and the beauties of rural nature; but an ideal pastoral
world was foreign to the scope of his genius,
and bucolick simplicity was not at all reconcilable with
his taste, which invariably inclined him to masculine
reflexion, clothed in a tone of didactic seriousness. He
would not, therefore, had he even possessed the natural
requisites for pastoral poetry, have been disposed to
prefer that style as the poetic form for occasional compositions,
however agreeable it might be to the individuals
of the royal family to have their festivals
poetically illustrated by such contributions to the general
gallantry of the court.</p>

<p id="His_epistles_125">Ferreira’s epistles occupy the chief portion of the
first volume of his poems; and they are, upon the
whole, entitled to the first rank in the poet’s works.
It is worthy of remark, that these epistles retain the
old title of <i>Cartas</i> instead of that of <i>Epistolas</i>, notwithstanding
Ferreira’s predilection for latinity in his
choice of words. But they differ in so many various
ways from the poetic <i>Cartas</i> of Saa de Miranda, that
they may be regarded as the first productions of their
kind in Portuguese literature. Their contents evidently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
shew that they were all written when the poet had attained
the age of maturity. At that period he resided
at court, and from his practical philosophy, for which
he was partly indebted to his literary studies, he deduced
the maxims which daily received confirmation
from the events of real life. Yet the more he was tied
to the great world, the more valuable did retirement
appear to him. The natural nobleness of his turn of
mind was constantly at variance with the manners and
characters of the persons by whom he was surrounded.
In this state of feeling he wrote his epistles. They are
for the most part addressed to men of the first rank,
with whom Ferreira was more or less intimate, and
among whose names appear those of the most celebrated
poets who laboured in common with him for the classic
improvement of the national taste. The didactic poems
addressed by Ferreira to these men are nearly all in the
same strain. The delicacy of the didactic tone of
Horace was not to be attained by a poet who had to
open the first path for the restoration of classical style
in a country in which the old romantic character in
poetry, and the scholastic theological spirit in philosophy,
were only beginning to yield to the influence
of a more liberal cultivation. Neither was Ferreira,
with all his elegance, sufficiently cultivated for that
Horatian gaiety, which frequently rises to wanton
sportiveness, and jests with the very precepts it inculcates.
The characteristics of his philosophy are
dignified gravity and sound judgment, unalloyed by any
thing like pedantry or pretension. But the philosophic
medium through which he viewed the vicissitudes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
fortune and the follies of mankind, partook more of
religious austerity than of epicurean pleasantry; and notwithstanding
his general correctness in epistolary composition,
even in that respect, he falls, like almost every
other modern poet, far short of the energetic precision
of the Horatian style. As an epistolary poet, therefore,
Ferreira is no more a Portuguese Horace than the two
Argensolas are Horaces in Spanish literature.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> But
the sound judgment and noble feeling, which may be
said to form the moral soul of these poems, are expressed
in that natural, unostentatious, pleasing and
varied manner, which belongs to the true spirit of the
didactic epistle; and the poet’s fancy has scattered as
many flowers on the path of ornate wisdom, as are
necessary to distinguish it from the high road of
moralizing prose. Patriotism and zeal for the national
greatness of Portugal give a peculiar colouring to these
epistles. In the spirit of this feeling Ferreira extols
the union of Portuguese military glory, with the
improvement of manners and the cultivation of the
understanding; and with regard to cultivation, according
to models, he says&mdash;one should seek to “excel
others in what is best, and only in other respects to
imitate.”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> He zealously exhorts his friend Andrade
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
Caminha not to make the muses in Portugal speak any
thing but Portuguese.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> He expresses his dissatisfaction
at the little encouragement which in his opinion was
extended to genius at that period in Portugal. He
also inveighs against the perverted appreciation of
good and bad, right and wrong.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> Within the limits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
of his faith, he himself discourses exquisitely on the
beauty of reason.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> But the soft language of feeling
more particularly glows in those epistles in which he
speaks of the joys of friendship and the pleasures of
rural life.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> Occasionally Ferreira’s didactic style takes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
an ironic jocular turn, and then only does it present
true Horatian facility.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> Upon the whole if the poetry
of reason and sentiment be not more lightly esteemed
than the poetry of luxuriant fancy, Ferreira’s epistles
must be numbered among the best in modern literature.</p>

<p id="His_epigrams_130">Ferreira endeavoured to introduce epigrams, composed
after the manner of the ancients, into the poetry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
of his native country. But he did not succeed in
seizing the spirit of the ancient epigram. Ausonius
was his model; and the <i>epigrammas</i> and <i>epitaphios</i>
which appear among the works of Ferreira are not
distinguished either by the tenderness or the energy of
the esteemed Greek poems of the same class. Their
chief merit is an elegant precision of language conveyed
in the metrical form of the Italian octaves; but it is
only in a few instances that this elegant precision
is in any degree poignant and pleasing.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> The epitaphs
are in general dedicated to the memory of men
distinguished in Portuguese history.</p>

<p>Ferreira is the author of a tale written in honour
of a female national saint, named <i>Colomba</i>, or, according
to the popular pronunciation, <i>Comba</i>. Beauty of language
also constitutes the whole poetic merit of this
piece; and even the introduction, which is long and
tedious, sufficiently proves that when Ferreira undertook
to celebrate the virtues of St. Colomba he stepped
out of his sphere. The subject of the tale is a legend
which might have formed the ground-work of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
better production. The fair saint, a Portuguese shepherdess,
tending her flocks and singing pious songs,
becomes the object of the ardent passion of a Moorish
king, who discovers her in one of his hunting excursions.
The king pursues her until she has no longer any hope
of saving herself by flight. In this extremity she implores
a rock to open and receive her. The miracle
takes place. The disappointed king strikes his lance
against the rock, and a clear fountain gushes forth,
the waters of which continue to possess miraculous
properties. The narrative is, however, much too cold
for such a subject; and the description given of the
Moorish king is so extremely grotesque, that it is
difficult to conceive how a man of Ferreira’s taste could
have brought himself to sketch so rude a picture. He has
represented the king as being covered with shag like a
bear; and in addition to this ornament has given to one
side of his head the ear of an ass, and to the other the
ear of a dog.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p id="His_tragedy_132">Ferreira likewise wished to introduce into the dramatic
poetry of Portugal a classical style, approximating
to that of the ancients as closely as the difference
of times and manners would permit. Among his dramatic
works there are a tragedy and two comedies.
Ferreira’s patriotic feeling induced him to borrow the
subject of his tragedy from the history of Portugal;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
and he selected the story of Inez de Castro, which has
since been so frequently handled by Portuguese poets,
though before Ferreira’s time it seems to have been untouched.
When it is recollected that at the same
period the Dominican Bermudez was engaged in writing
a Spanish tragedy on the same story, and according to
similar principles,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> the conclusion that one of these tragedies
in some measure owes its existence to the other
is not easily avoided. Both present a striking similarity
in invention and arrangement. But neither poet alludes
in any way to his contemporary; and even the critics
who notice the one work are silent with respect to
the other. The prize of tragic art must, however, be
awarded to the Inez de Castro of Bermudez. Ferreira’s
<i>Castro</i> (for so the tragedy is briefly called by the
Portuguese) contains many beautiful passages; but
throughout the whole piece there is a deficiency of true
pathos; the imitation of the Greek style in form and
manner is painfully elaborate; the dramatic, interest of
the composition is extremely feeble, and the dignity of
tragic poetry is maintained in the language alone.
Inez de Castro with her attendant or nurse (<i>ama</i>), the
Infante Don Pedro with his secretary, King Alphonso
with his three inhuman counsellors, and finally a messenger,
are the acting or rather the speaking characters;
and a chorus of Coimbrian women are brought into co-operation
with these characters in the same manner as
in the tragedy of Bermudez. Ferreira, like Bermudez,
deviates from the strict laws of the Greek drama only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
in the neglect of the unities of time and place; and it is
evident that this liberty is by both poets only taken
from necessity, because they had not sufficient art otherwise
to connect the requisite scenes. Both tragedies
contain in appearance five acts; but Ferreira has also
rendered his fifth act merely an historical appendage.
In the opening of Ferreira’s tragedy Inez enters with
her attendant, and after some preliminary complaints
circumstantially relates the way in which she became
connected with the Prince, and through him with the
royal family; though it may be presumed that these
particulars must have been sufficiently well known to
her confidante long before. The scene changes, and the
Infante appears accompanied by the female chorus, which
Bermudez has more suitably introduced in connection
with Inez. The Infante engages in a long discussion
with his secretary on the situation of a Prince who has
to maintain a conflict between love, and duty and policy.
A hymn to love by the chorus closes the first act. The
following acts are constructed in a similar manner. At
the close of the fourth act the death of Inez is announced
by the chorus; and in the fifth a messenger
relates the event to the Prince. The lyric passages are
the best in the whole tragedy, and among them the
hymn to love is particularly beautiful.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> The lines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
which Inez delivers on her first entrance indicate
at once the lyric character of the piece. The dialogue
is elegant throughout, but it frequently exhibits
over-strained antitheses. The observations occasionally
delivered by the chorus, in a metre formed
on the model of the sapphic, are sufficiently moral,
though they are in general of the commonest character.
The decisive scene, in which Inez appears before the
king, approaches nearest to true pathos, but never
completely attains that height.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> Upon the whole Ferreira
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
was not a tragic poet. He totally failed in seizing
the true idea of modern tragedy.</p>

<p>In spirit and in form Ferreira’s two comedies
perfectly resemble those of Saa de Miranda. One
which is called “Bristo,” (<i>Comedia do Bristo</i>) takes
its name from the principal character in the piece.
The other is entitled the “Jealous Man,” (<i>Comedia
do Cioso</i>). The comedy of Bristo was the production
of Ferreira’s early youth. In his dedication to the
king, he says that he wrote it during the holidays,
in the course of the few days which he was able to
snatch from his more serious studies at the university of
Coimbra. To this task he was in all probability incited
by the example of Saa de Miranda. It may also be
presumed that at a subsequent period, Ferreira gave a
finer polish to this comedy, to which Portuguese writers
usually refer, when they wish to prove how admirably
their native language is adapted to light and elegant
prose. But it is not merely in this philological point of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
view that the merits of this work ought to be estimated.
In facility, precision and elegance of dialogue, it surpasses
the comedies of Saa de Miranda, and many which
in other respects are justly ranked among the best
in modern literature. The delineation of character, so
far as it goes, is natural and decided: indeed some of the
characters, among which is a hectoring profligate knight
of Rhodes, who resembles the ostentatious soldiers of
Plautus, are particularly well sustained. In the <i>Comedia
do Cioso</i>, the principal character, though somewhat
overcharged, is strikingly sketched. Both dramas
contain some comic scenes; but they are upon the whole
as deficient in real comic force as they are overburthened
with common place morality; and that morality
too, as in the comedies of Saa de Miranda, is conveyed
in tedious soliloquies.</p>

<p>But the public favour which the court conferred on
the regular dramas of Ferreira, in common with those of
Saa de Miranda, and the rude compositions of Gil Vicente,
may be regarded as one of the circumstances
which operated to prevent the formation of a national
drama in Portugal. For the rise, as in Spain, of a national
party, which might rouse and incite a poet to advance
from the point at which Gil Vicente had stopped, became
now much more difficult. Thus the art of dramatic
invention and composition long wavered amidst heterogeneous
forms, until the Portuguese poets who
wished to write for the theatre, had no alternative but
to become imitators of the Spanish authors who had
preceded them, or entirely to renounce the formation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
of any thing like a national drama. No Portuguese
Lope de Vega arose; and Ferreira’s name was only
preserved in the recollection of the learned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After having perused with critical reflection the
history of Portuguese poetry and eloquence, from the
introduction of the Italian style to the present point,
the reader will be prepared to recognize the rank which
Camoens holds among the poets of his country. Respecting
this most celebrated of the Portuguese poets,
indeed almost the only one among them who has obtained
any celebrity beyond the limits of his native
country, all the writers of the classic school of Saa de
Miranda, Diogo Bernardes excepted, are silent, which
is a sufficient proof that they did not include him in
their party. But the public voice of Portuguese criticism,
combined with the general national approbation,
has long since elevated him above those who neglected
to mention his name, though they were always ready to
bestow praise on each other. Camoens, it is true, was
a poor adventurer, wandering in India, at the period
when Ferreira, Andrade Caminha, and other contemporary
writers were setting the poetic fashion at the brilliant
court of Lisbon. But the poems which he produced
previously to his departure for India, approximate in a
striking degree to the classic works of the school of Saa
de Miranda; and hence it is probable that the influence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
of that school, and of the older Portuguese poetry, may
have operated in an equal degree on his genius. This
relationship of Camoens with all parties in the polite
literature of his native country, will be placed in the
clearest point of view by introducing him after Ferreira,
and before the other poets, who hand in hand with the
latter pursued the newly opened course. Thus the
genius of Camoens, as the first of Portuguese poets,
may be considered conjointly with his merits as a poet
in the spirit of the age in which he lived.</p>


<h3 id="Camoens_139">CAMOENS.</h3>

<p>The biography of Luis de Camões, or Camoens,
again brings to recollection that period in which the
poets of Portugal considered their character very imperfectly
maintained, if their real life did not prove a
faithful mirror of the poetic joys and sorrows embodied
in their works. Camoens was born at Lisbon, probably
in the year 1524. His parents, as it appears, were not
rich; but they belonged to the class of ancient nobility,
and they were enabled to give their son an education
which facilitated his entrance on the career of military
and civic honor. From his father, who was captain of
a vessel, and who lost his life in shipwreck on the
coast of India, it is probable that Camoens heard many
stories, which were calculated to inspire him with a
taste for adventure and daring enterprize. Of the history
of his early youth no remarkable particulars are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
recorded. He attended the university of Coimbra,
where he acquired a fund of historical and mythological
knowledge. Some of his elegies and sonnets
which have descended to posterity, seem to have been
written at this period, though it does not appear that
those productions gained for him the friendship of Ferreira,
and other contemporaries of eminent talent, who
were about the same time studying at Coimbra. It is
probable that these young men, who had joined in a
mutual and earnest endeavour to attain classic correctness,
anticipated nothing extraordinary from the ardent
Camoens, who adopted the new style, but did not disdain
the old, and whose fancy was too restless to submit
to the didactic controul of the judgment. On quitting
the university Camoens returned to Lisbon, but with
what design is not mentioned by Portuguese authors,
nor has any conjecture been formed respecting the views
of success which he might have had in that city. He
soon, however, became an object of public notoriety
through his imprudent conduct in gallantry, which,
next to poetry, at that time engrossed his thoughts.
The particulars of a love affair, in which he became
involved, are not accurately known; and, therefore, how
far with respect to it, he was to blame, cannot now
be ascertained. It however appears, that the object of
his regard was named Catharina de Attayda, and that
she was a <i>dama do paço</i>, (lady of honor) at the court.
Either on account of this lady, or of some other
circumstance which operated unfavourably for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
romantic poet, he was banished from Lisbon; and with
this event commences the second part of the life of this
extraordinary man.</p>

<p>Thus cut off in the age of aspiring pretension and
glowing enthusiasm, from the hope of advancing by the
course usually open to youthful ambition, Camoens remained
for some time tranquilly at Santarem, the place
of his exile, in the neighbourhood of Lisbon. There
instead of considering what was now necessary to be
done with a view to his future welfare, he occupied
himself in writing verses, which have been handed
down to posterity, but which only served to fix more
deeply a passion the object of which was still near him.
With a caprice not uncommon in such a state of feeling,
Camoens, who cherished at once romantic ideas of
patriotism, and indignant emotions of disgust, suddenly
changed the whole system of his life. He became a
soldier, and served against the Moors as a volunteer on
board the Portuguese fleet in the Mediterranean. To
be at once a hero and a poet was now the object of his
ambition. Whenever time and opportunity permitted,
he composed verses, which often, particularly those of
the lyric and elegiac class, had for their subject the recollection
of his hopeless passion. Whether he had at
this period clearly conceived the plan of his national
heroic poem, or whether he was actually engaged in its
execution, are questions which, like almost every other
fact relative to the history of this poet’s talent, remain
enveloped in doubt. It is known, however, that he
combated the enemies of his country in a naval battle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
fought off Ceuta. During this action, in which he
eminently distinguished himself, he received a gun-shot
wound in consequence of which he lost the sight of his
right eye. He now hoped to obtain, in the character
of a hero, that reward which he had failed to acquire as
a poet. He returned to Lisbon. But no individual at
court took any active interest in his welfare. All his
efforts to gain an honourable competence were unsuccessful;
and he was now verging on the age of maturity.
More dissatisfied, and yet more proud than ever, he
loudly accused his country of ingratitude, while at
the same time his poetic effusions prove that his heart
overflowed with the warmest feelings of national attachment.
At last, determined to leave for ever a land to
which his heart was still bound by the ties of another
passion besides patriotism, he embarked in the year
1553, at the age of twenty-nine, for India. That his
thankless country should not have even his bones, was
the sentiment which, on his departure, his indignant
feelings prompted him to exclaim in the words of
Scipio:&mdash;<i>Ingrata patria, non possidebis ossa mea!</i></p>

<p>From this period the life of Camoens exhibits a
chain of successive adventures and calamities; but fate
watched over him with miraculous care, and seemed to
rescue him from every danger in order that he might
complete his poetic career. The squadron with which
he sailed to India consisted of four ships. Three were
lost in a storm, but Camoens arrived on board the
fourth, in the port of Goa. From this circumstance he
augured that fortune was now about to smile on him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
He soon found, however, that employment was not to
be obtained at Goa, and he entered as a volunteer in a
military corps, forming part of an expedition which the
Portuguese viceroy was fitting out for the aid of an
Indian prince. On the arrival of the troops at the
place of their destination, a great portion of the Portuguese
fell a sacrifice to the insalubrity of the climate;
but Camoens returned in safety to Goa after the object
of the expedition had been attained. In the situation
in which he then stood, there remained for him no other
alternative than to embark in a new expedition which
was about to sail for the Red Sea to attack the Arabian
corsairs. At the island of Ormus, where he passed the
winter, Camoens again found leisure to indulge in the
workings of his imagination. His mind gave a poetic
colouring to every thing which he saw or heard; and
the ardour of his patriotism continued to increase in
proportion as he became more intimately acquainted
with the theatre of the Portuguese atchievements in
India. But many circumstances which came within
his observation induced him also to indulge in satirical
sports of wit. The government of Goa had hitherto
done nothing for him. He did not, however, try to
promote his interest by flattery. On the contrary, he
ridiculed the <i>disparates na India</i>, (follies in India)
as he unceremoniously styled some portion of the proceedings
of the government of Goa. The viceroy, who
took particular umbrage at this satire, banished Camoens
to the Chinese island of Macao. The fate of
the unfortunate hero and poet was now more deplorable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
than ever. He however gained permission to quit Macao
and visit the Molucca islands, where he collected
fresh materials for pictorial poetry; but he could no
longer, as the lines beneath his portrait express, “bear
in one hand the sword, in the other the pen.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>” He was
glad to accept the very unpoetic and unheroic post of
<i>provedor mòr dos defuntos</i>, (administrator of the
effects of deceased persons) by the emoluments of which
he was enabled to subsist. Whenever circumstances
permitted he turned his attention to his heroic poem,
and thus indemnified himself in the ideal world for the
part which he was compelled to perform in real life.
At length, on the arrival of a new viceroy at Goa, he
obtained permission to return to that island, but in the
passage thither was shipwrecked on the coast of Camboya.
With difficulty he saved his life, and also his
poem, the manuscript of which, soaked with sea-water,
he brought to land. This circumstance is noticed in
the work itself.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> The story of his swimming ashore
with his poem in one hand, while he supported himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
by the action of the other, and thus saving his <i>Lusiadas</i>
as Cæsar saved his commentaries, has obtained currency
through the statement of a German writer, who seems
to have misunderstood a very intelligible passage of a
Portuguese author.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> On his return to Goa, Camoens
was well received; but he had not long enjoyed the
smiles of fortune, when another change took place in
the viceroyship. The new viceroy lent a ready ear to
the enemies of the poet, who was now publicly accused
of malversation in the discharge of the office which he
had filled at Macao. Camoens was thrown into prison,
and there left to work out his justification. It appears
he fully cleared himself of the charges which had been
brought against him; but he was still detained because
he was unable to satisfy the demands of his creditors.
A poem, which he addressed to the viceroy, at length
procured his liberation. After experiencing many other
disagreeable adventures he ardently wished to return to
Europe, but it was not in his power to defray the expence
of his passage. Even when prepared to embark
he was stopped by a demand for the re-payment of a
loan, and was nearly reduced to despair, but several
liberal individuals stepped forward and provided the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
sum necessary for his relief. Finally, in the year 1569,
Camoens, after an absence of nearly sixteen years,
arrived at Lisbon, from the rich shores of India, well
in health, but in a state of the most abject poverty.</p>

<p>The third part of the history of this ill-fated poet
is the most melancholy. On his return he found Lisbon
ravaged by the plague. During this calamity it was not
to be expected that much regard should be paid to poetry,
and the last hope of Camoens rested on his poem, the
only treasure which he had brought with him from
India. Considerable changes had likewise taken place
at the court. King Sebastian was concerting the plan
of his unfortunate expedition to Morocco. In so romantic
an enterprise Camoens was predisposed to take
an interest, and it served to stimulate his zeal in dedicating
his poem to the youthful sovereign. The dedication
was graciously received, but the poet obtained
no other reward than a wretched pension, just sufficient
to mark but not to relieve his misery. The honour was
conceded to him of constantly accompanying the court,
while he wanted means to procure the necessaries of
life. It is said that a faithful slave who had accompanied
him to Europe, begged in the streets of
Lisbon at night, in order to enable the poet, whose
name was now celebrated throughout Portugal and
Spain, to appear decently in public during the day.
The last blow which the patriotic heart of Camoens
received, was the fatal issue of the African expedition.
The poet’s hitherto robust constitution now sank under
the pressure of sorrow and indigence. His last hope
had vanished, and overwhelmed with affliction, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
withdrew himself from the world. A few monks were
the last individuals with whom he maintained any intercourse.
Shortly before his death, he is said to have
written a letter, which, if it be genuine, proves that he
himself considered his misfortunes unparalleled. He
styles it a sort of presumptuousness to attempt to oppose
that fate, which had at length compressed all his
sorrows within the narrow limits of a sick-bed. It
appears that he ended his life in an hospital, in the
year 1579, at the age of fifty-five. It was not until
sixteen years after his decease that the spot where his
ashes repose, was distinguished by a monument erected
by one of his admirers. During the same year the
learned Rodriguez Lobo Zurupita, who must not be
confounded with the poet Rodriguez Lobo, published
the first collection of the hitherto scattered poems of
Camoens.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p id="General_character_148">The life of Camoens constitutes an essential part of
the history of Portuguese poetry. With the exception
of Dante no poet of the first rank has in his works so
fully represented his own inward feelings combined with
every extraordinary circumstance that came within his
observation. His poems can only be perfectly intelligible
to the reader who never loses sight of the poet;
for his character is precisely theirs. But the poetry
of Camoens must not on this account be confounded
with the self-subjective effusions of certain enthusiasts
who express their feelings clearly enough in verse,
though not in poetry, except, perhaps, in their own
opinion. Among the poets of all ages Camoens is one
of the most eminent; and though to a foreigner it may
at first sight seem strange that he has permanently
obtained in the literature of his country the surname
of <i>O Grande</i> (the Great), a title given in
history only to a few distinguished sovereigns, yet in
the unbounded homage which the Portuguese render to
the name of the man, who during his life was suffered
to languish in penury, the citizen of the world will
readily recognize a general desire to compensate for
the injustice with which he was treated by his contemporaries.
On this side of the Pyrenees, indeed, however
frequently the name of Camoens may be mentioned and
written, as a poet he is still scarcely known except
by name. But to form a just appreciation of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
merit, he must, like Homer, be viewed in the spirit
of his nation and his age. It was the ambition of
Camoens to be to the Portuguese what Homer was to
the Greeks, the first and at the same time the most
national of poets; and if he did not entirely attain
his end, he nevertheless so far approached it that no
other modern poet has been able to combine all the
national interests of his country, with the fulness of
poetic spirit exhibited in the Lusiad. But it must be
recollected that at the period when Camoens wrote, the
more correct style, formed on the ancient and Italian
models, had just penetrated into Portuguese literature,
and that it had not yet taken deep root. Under these
circumstances, Camoens, in sketching the plan of his
national Epopœia, stood, as it were, severed from the
age in which he lived. Modern literature contained
no similar work, and, generally speaking, no epic poem
worthy of perusal, except the chivalrous compositions
of Bojardo and Ariosto. From Trissino Camoens could
learn nothing; from Bojardo and Ariosto he might have
learned much, but assuredly not the spirit and style of
a serious national heroic poem; and Camoens was numbered
with the dead before Tasso’s Jerusalem Delivered
appeared in print.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Camoens was the first modern who
succeeded in the production of a serious heroic poem.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
But with all his endeavours to attain classic perfection,
he was a Portuguese in the spirit of his age, and too
good a patriot to wish to be any thing else. He rose
to the height at which he aimed only by flights; having
reached it he sank, rose to it again, and again fell from
it. He was unable to produce a classically perfect whole
of any extent. But the more beautiful passages of his
poems, particularly of his Lusiad, will stand the test of
the most rigid criticism according to the rules of pure
poetry and classic excellence.</p>

<p>Every style of poetic composition of which he had
formed a definite idea was attempted by Camoens. But
the Lusiad rises so vastly above his other works, and
bears such powerful and various traces of the peculiar
character of his poetry, that all his lesser compositions
must be considered merely as inferior scions sprung
from the same root.</p>

<p id="Character_150">The Lusiad of Camoens is a heroic poem; but so
essentially different in the unity of the epic plan from
all other heroic poems, that to avoid falling into the unwarrantable
misconception with which this noble work
is every where judged except in Portugal and Spain, it
is necessary in considering it, to drop the ordinary rules
of comparison, and to proceed upon the general idea of
epic poetry unmodified by any prepossession for known
models.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> Camoens struck out a totally new path in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
the region of epopœia. The style of his poem is indeed
formed chiefly on the ancient models, and in his
diction he has imitated the elegant stanzas of the Italians;
but the epic idea of the work is entirely his own;
and the kind of composition, which forms its groundwork,
was something entirely new in poetic literature.
The object of Camoens was to recount in epic strains,
with pure poetic feeling, the atchievements of the heroes
and great men of Portugal in general, not of any individual
in particular, and consequently not of Vasco
da Gama, who is commonly considered the hero of
the Lusiad. He was not to be satisfied with drawing
up a poetically adorned official report, like the
Spanish Araucana, written at a later period by Ercilla.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
The title which Camoens gave to his heroic
poem sufficiently denotes the nature of its subject. He
named it <i>Os Lusiadas</i>, that is to say, the Lusitanians,
or Portuguese. This choice of a title was doubtless
influenced by the prevailing taste of the Portuguese
poets of that age, to whom the common name of their
nation appeared unpoetic, and also by the popular notion
that the favourite term <i>Lusitania</i> was derived from a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
certain mythological hero, named <i>Lusus</i>, who visited
Portugal in company with Ulysses, and who conjointly
with the Greek warrior, built the city of Lisbon (<i>Ulyssipolis</i>).
Camoens is not to blame if the editors of
his poem, wishing to reconcile its somewhat unusual
title with the names of other epic compositions, have
converted the <i>Lusiadas</i> into the <i>Lusiada</i>.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> But the
poem may be designated by its common title without
offence to its spirit or its subject. At the same time it
must not be forgotten that the Lusiad is a totally different
kind of heroic poem from all those epopees,
whether successful or unsuccessful, in which a single
hero is the main spring of the whole epic action. According
to the plan which Camoens sketched for his
national poem, he was enabled to dispense with the
choice of a hero whose atchievements should throw
those of all others into the shade, and form the sole
source of epic interest. To this plan, however, an
essential beauty of epic poetry was necessarily sacrificed.
The composition lost the advantage of those
little groupes of characters which would otherwise have
been assembled around the principal character. From
its plan, therefore, the Lusiad cannot be accounted such
a model of epic perfection as the Iliad, or even as the
Æneid, in which that perfection more faintly presented
is still to be found. But as a narrative poem, deriving
a total effect from the union of its parts, the Lusiad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
may be considered an epic whole, and consequently, a
poem entirely different in kind from the Metamorphoses
of Ovid, or even the <i>Divina Comedia</i> of Dante.
A poetic and epic grouping of all the great and most
interesting events in the annals of his native country,
was what Camoens wished to accomplish. He therefore
very happily selected the event which constitutes
the most brilliant epoch in Portuguese history, as a
common keeping point for all the different parts of his
epic picture. The discovery of the passage to India
by Vasco da Gama was certainly not an heroic atchievement
in the usual sense of the term, but in that age,
when such adventures bordered on the incredible, it
was a truly heroic enterprize. Camoens made this
event the groundwork of the epic unity of his poem.
But in that unity Vasco da Gama is merely the spindle
round which the thread of the narrative is wound.
His dignity, as the leader of his intrepid countrymen,
renders him in some degree conspicuous; but in other
respects he is not distinguished, and the interest of the
whole poem depends no more on him than on his companions.
The heroes who shine with the greatest lustre
in the Lusiad, even the Constable, Nuno Alvarez Pereira,
who is the most remarkable among them, are all introduced
in what are styled the episodes. But the Lusiad
has in reality no episode, except the short story of the
giant Adamastor. Another portion of the work, which
is commonly called an episode, is a poetic sketch from
the ancient history of Portugal, and belongs as essentially
to the whole as any of the other principal parts of the
great picture. It even occupies nearly one half of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
poem. It is precisely on these parts, called episodes,
that the epic grandeur of the whole composition rests;
and in them the finest passages of the poem occur.
Unless the idea of the plan of the Lusiad be rightly
seized, the composition will appear in a false light on
whatever side it may be viewed.</p>

<p>The Lusiad, designated as a whole, may therefore
be termed an epic national picture of Portuguese glory,
something greater than a mere gallery of poetic stories,
but less than a perfect epopee. The principles of the
composition are exceedingly simple; but that they
may not be misconceived, it is necessary to understand
the epic machinery of the poem, as the poet himself
would have it understood, and as it was understood
in the spirit of the age by his contemporaries. Camoens
was too truly a poet to exclude from his Lusiad
the charm of the marvellous and the co-operation of
supernatural beings. But he was either accidentally
less happy than Tasso in the choice of epic machinery
for a modern heroic poem, or he purposely preferred the
Greek mythology as the most beautiful. Nothing prevented
him from assigning the necessary parts in his
machinery to the good and bad agents of popular
christian belief; and the subject seems particularly
calculated for such an application as the diffusion of
christianity by the discoveries and conquests of the Portuguese
is in the poem itself made the highest merit of
the nation. Camoens, however, appears to have been of
opinion that an epic poem, such as he had planned,
should be adorned with learning, and particularly mythological
learning; and besides, by the introduction of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
Greek deities the whole composition seemed to be raised
to the true poetic region of the ancient epopœia. Thus
there remains the singular incongruity of the Greek
mythology and the atchievements of the Portuguese
christians, who, on no occasion neglect to act and discourse
in the true spirit of their faith. But in the
mind of Camoens this incongruity was removed by the
opinion, which he shared in common with his contemporaries,
that the machinery in epopœia was merely a
poetic figure, and that all the heathen deities might be
introduced as allegorical characters, in modern narrative
poetry, by the same privilege which enables Cupid to
retain his place in the lyric compositions of christian
poets, without any theological or literary offence. Thus
Camoens allegorically introduced Olympus into his poem.
The erroneous opinion which misled the poet does not,
it is true, redeem this defect in the poem, though it
contributes to cast a veil over it. But if the reader
admits this opinion, which he must do in order to understand
the poet in his own sense, then will even the
offence against taste be found to vanish imperceptibly.
This compromise once made, the whole poem becomes
not only singular, but even wonderful in its singularity,
particularly where Vasco da Gama and his companions
sport with Thetis and her nymphs allegorically, and
yet in good earnest; and the historical material begins,
as if suddenly ennobled by magic, to shine in the full
light of poetry.</p>

<p>The Lusiad assumes a mythological character immediately
after the introductory stanzas. Vasco da
Gama with his squadron has already doubled the Cape
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
of Good Hope; and steering along the eastern coast of
Africa, he approaches the Indian seas. The gods are
then assembled on Olympus, to deliberate on the fate of
India. Venus and Bacchus form two parties, the former
in favour of the Portuguese, and the latter against them.
In this application of the allegory, the poet, doubtless,
gratified his patriotic pride; for Portugal was, even by
the Spaniards, styled the native land of love; and temperance
in the use of wine, was a national virtue of the
Portuguese. In order to give a still higher import to
this allegory, Venus is made to consider the Portuguese
as modern Romans, and to entertain for them the same regard
which she formerly extended to the people of ancient
Rome: but Bacchus recollects his expedition in India,
and is indignant at the Portuguese, whose enterprize
threatens to eclipse his glory. Among the gods who declare
themselves friendly to the Portuguese, Mars is particularly
conspicuous. Meanwhile Vasco da Gama’s fleet
touches at several places on the coast of eastern Africa.
Vasco endeavours to enter into amicable relations with
the King of Mombaza; but Bacchus transforms himself
into a Mahometan priest, and by treacherous tokens of
friendship plans the destruction of the Portuguese in
Mombaza. Venus, however, discovers the treachery in
time to prevent it. She appeals to Jupiter. Her prayers
for the Portuguese fleet are heard. Mercury warns
Vasco da Gama in a dream, and Vasco escapes the danger
that is prepared for him. He sails onward to the
African kingdom of Melinda. The King of Melinda,
though also a Mahometan, gives a hospitable reception
to the Portuguese, whose courage and national glory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
excite his warmest admiration. Here the poet connects
the thread of those narratives which have been erroneously
regarded as the episodes of the Lusiad. At the
request of the King of Melinda, Vasco da Gama relates
the most interesting incidents of Portuguese history,
and closes his patriotic narrative with a description of
his own voyage up to the period of his arrival at Melinda.
The King of Melinda now becomes the enthusiastic
friend of the Portuguese; and here the second
half of the poem commences. Vasco da Gama proceeds
on his voyage with the pilots, who are to shew him the
nearest course to India. Bacchus, however, descends
to the bottom of the sea, and implores the gods and
goddesses of Neptune’s kingdom, to assist him in destroying
the Portuguese fleet before it shall reach India.
A dreadful storm arises, and seems to promise the accomplishment
of Bacchus’s wish: but at the critical
moment Venus again rescues her favourites, and the
Portuguese arrive in safety at the kingdom of Calicut,
on the coast of Malabar. Vasco da Gama is at first
very favourably received by the Zamorim, or Prince of
Calicut. This opportunity is seized by Camoens to
supply a sort of supplement to the poetic narrative of
the events of Portuguese history; for he makes Paulo
da Gama, the brother of the admiral, explain to the
Catual, or Indian governor of Calicut, the historical
tapestries and pictures on board the Portuguese ships.
At length, Bacchus, who is not yet weary of playing
the part of a Mussulman, for the annoyance of the
Portuguese, stirs up such a misunderstanding between
Vasco da Gama and the Zamorim of Calicut, that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
projected commercial treaty between Calicut and Portugal
is set aside, and the Portuguese fleet is once more
exposed to the risk of destruction. But the grand
object of the voyage is now attained, and Vasco da
Gama weighs anchor, and directs his course back to
Europe. During the homeward voyage Venus prepares
for the enterprizing navigators a brilliant festival on an
enchanted island in the great ocean, where goddesses
and sea nymphs, wounded by Cupid’s darts, become
enamoured of the Portuguese who land on the island.
The voluptuous magic festival, at which the goddess
Thetis, or Tethys, (for both names denote the same
deity), becomes the bride of Vasco da Gama, affords the
poet the last opportunity of completing his picture of
Portuguese national glory; for a prophetic nymph relates
the most conspicuous atchievements of the Portuguese
commanders in India, and Thetis taking Vasco to
the top of a high mountain, explains to him on a magic
globe the geographical positions of the different countries.</p>

<p>All the objections which may be urged against an
epic composition of this kind, are so very obvious, that
from a mere sketch of the contents of the Lusiad, it is
impossible to conceive how a poet, even of the most
uncommon talents, could form a grand and beautiful
whole on a plan at once so trivial and so irregular. But
the plan of the composition of this poem resembles a
scaffolding, which is surrounded and concealed by the
beauty and grandeur of the building; and which serves
to connect the parts in a singular kind of union, yet
has no share in producing the unity of the effect. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
unity of effect, and consequently of the poem, rests
wholly and solely on the execution of the plan, out of
which only a poet like Camoens could have created a
Lusiad. But the historian of Portuguese poetry, who is
not inclined to concede the just claims which this poem
possesses on the admiration of all ages, must present to
his readers another and a totally different analysis of the
work from that which has just been given. A suitable
opportunity will thus be afforded for more particularly
noticing the beauties with which the Lusiad abounds,
and the faults in which it is not deficient.</p>

<p>The introductory stanzas mark with sufficient precision
the tone which the poem maintains to its close.
“Arms and the renowned men, who from the western
shore of Lusitania, penetrated beyond Taprobana by
seas never before navigated; who amidst frightful dangers
and warfare accomplished more than could be
expected from human powers, and in a remote region
of the world founded and raised a new kingdom: also
the glorious atchievements of those kings, who extended
their faith and their dominion, and spread terror through
the wicked regions of Africa and Asia; and others whose
glorious deeds have raised them above the laws of mortality;”
are announced as the objects of the poet’s strains.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
Then follows an effusion which has more of a patriotic
than a poetic character, combined with a panegyrical
dedication to King Sebastian, containing no less than
sixteen stanzas. The narrative which commences with
the nineteenth stanza opens amidst the course of the
events, and in a truly epic strain.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> The reader may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
now readily perceive that he must not expect to find
in the Lusiad a work written in the spirit and the style
of classic antiquity. It betrays indeed a certain degree
of loquacity which seems to run counter to the effect
of the lofty epic. But there is something captivating
in the enthusiasm of the poet’s manner; his patriotism
rouses sympathetic feelings; we expect to find his poem
the offspring of an overflowing heart; we are charmed
with the natural, elegant and noble language of the
work; and as soon as the narrative begins, the poetic
point of view seems likewise to be fixed. The mythological
machinery which Camoens conceived to be indispensably
necessary to epic dignity, forms a peculiar
kind of ornament, for which indeed the reader is
prepared from the commencement of the poem. The
description of the council of the gods on Olympus,
with which the narrative opens, though somewhat at
variance with the ancient costume, is nevertheless
pleasing and not devoid of dignity. Here the poetic
spirit of Camoens is evinced in some picturesque comparisons
in which he vies even with Homer. All these
similies bear the impress of the poet’s powers of active
perception and representation. They are neither far
fetched nor common, and they abound in poetic truth
and energy.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> In the forty-fourth stanza, Vasco da
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
Gama is for the first time mentioned, and in few words
characterized as a man of “proud and lofty spirit, on
whom fortune ever smiled.”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> But there soon occur
passages in which the poetic light of the representation
is totally extinguished.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> Passages of this kind are
afterwards frequently repeated, and their prosaic dryness
is the more displeasing when contrasted with the
deep poetic spirit which pervades the more beautiful
parts of the composition. The description of the first
engagement between the Portuguese of Gama’s fleet
and the treacherous Moors of Mosambique, affords the
poet another opportunity of displaying his talent in
picturesque comparison. But it becomes obvious that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
this talent must have been formed on the model of
Ariosto rather than on that of Homer. There occur
indeed in his representations of the tumult of the
battle, some imitations of Ariostic exuberance, which
do not strictly harmonize with the prevailing style of
the Lusiad.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>In the second canto the singularity of the mythological
machinery becomes still more remarkable, when
at Mombassa, on the coast of Africa, Bacchus assumes
the disguise of a Christian priest, and on an enchanted
altar goes through the ceremony of the christian
worship for the purpose of deceiving the Portuguese.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
But the grotesque application of the machinery in this
passage, prepares the mind for scenes of a similar character,
and thus the comic effect of subsequent parts of
the poem is in anticipation softened. The reader who
enters into the spirit of the poet becomes unconsciously
accustomed to this view of the ancient mythology; and
he is even soon reconciled to the incongruity of Vasco
da Gama offering up prayers as a christian to Providence,
and those prayers being heard by Venus. The
description of Venus, who once more intercedes with
Jupiter in favour of the Portuguese, resembles Ariosto’s
description of Alcina. Here the poet for the first time
evinces his predilection for voluptuous pictures of beauty.
This charming description may be said to possess a nationally
classic character.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> The speech by which Vasco
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
da Gama’s ambassador gains the King of Melinda to
the interests of the Portuguese is excellent, and the
pompous meeting of the king with Vasco, on board the
Portuguese admiral ship, is elegantly and picturesquely
described.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the third canto, a new
life is infused into the poem. But to try this poetic
survey of Portuguese history, as it stands in connection
with the whole, by any rule of prosaic verisimilitude,
would be to depart from the poetic spirit of the Lusiad.
In order to understand the narrative which
Vasco da Gama relates to the King of Melinda, it is
necessary to possess that knowledge of the events
alluded to, which Camoens presumed every Portuguese
to possess, but which in all probability could not have
been possessed by a sovereign of Melinda. The reader
who peruses this narrative without the necessary knowledge
of the history of Portugal, will be incapable of
appreciating many of the most essential beauties of the
Lusiad. In so far as Camoens may be denominated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
the Portuguese Homer, he is indebted for that title to
the poetic epitome he has given of the history of his
country; and this epitome is a rapid succession of
pictures, which flit away like shadows, before those
who are unacquainted with their historical ground
work, for the poet evidently expected readers who
would be gratified to observe how art was capable of
elevating the events of real life to the region of epic
invention. This portion of the poem, which extends
from the third to the end of the fifth canto, contains
passages, which in point of classic elegance leave nothing
more to be desired; but even here Camoens has
in some instances made an unpoetic display of his erudition.
Previously to the narrative of Vasco da Gama,
the poet speaks in his own character, and patriotically
elevates the Portuguese nation above every other.
Vasco’s narrative commences with a cold geographical
enumeration of the different countries of Europe, in
which the Swedes, Danes, Prussians, Russians, and
Livonians are styled <i>estranha gente</i>, (strange people)
just as a modern traveller might speak of the
Ostiaks and the Samoides. Spain is denominated the
head of Europe, and Portugal the crown of that head.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>
Viewed in the light of probability, the invectives in
which Vasco da Gama at every opportunity indulges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
against the Mahometans, must be supposed offensive to
the King of Melinda; but Camoens, in his patriotic
zeal, lost sight of many circumstances which would
have claimed the consideration of any other poet.
Among the most beautiful passages in these three
cantos of the Lusiad, may be numbered the tribute to
the memory of Egaz Moniz, the Portuguese Regulus,
who, however, ended his career more happily than the
Roman consul;<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> the description of the battle of Ourique
which laid the foundation of the kingdom of Portugal;<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
the description of the visit of Queen Maria of Spain to
her father the King of Portugal, to implore assistance
for her husband in his contest with the Moors;<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
relation of the tragical fate of Inez de Castro, which
is the most celebrated of all the exquisitely beautiful
passages in the Lusiad;<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> the description of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
sanguinary battle of Aljuabarrota, the greatest victory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
the Portuguese ever gained over the Castilians:<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> and
some others, of the like character, which might still be
enumerated. The picture of the battle of Aljuabarrota
excels all the similar descriptions which occur even in
the Lusiad, remarkable as that poem is for such passages.
The valiant Nuno Alvares, who by his eloquence
and his personal authority, no less than by his
courage, saved the political existence of Portugal, shines
with such conspicuous lustre at the head of the Portuguese
warriors, that he with far more propriety than
Vasco da Grama might be denominated the hero of the
Lusiad, were it a work which ought to be judged according
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
to the rules usually applied to epic poetry.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>
Even in this great battle picture, the finest touches are
unquestionably copied from nature, for the poet was no
less in his place amidst the tumult of war than in the
more tranquil region of the Muses.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> In the continuation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
of the narrative of the first discoveries of the Portuguese
in the east, the particular interest which the poet
took in allegoric description is again displayed in a
novel manner. The two principal rivers of India, the
Indus and the Ganges, are made to appear to King
Emmanuel in a dream under the personification of two
old men. The representation is truly excellent.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>In Vasco da Gama’s narrative of his own voyage, the
following passages must always be particularly distinguished:
first, the description of the farewell to the Portuguese
shore:<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> secondly, a sort of didactic episode, consisting
of reflexions made by an old man on the vanity of
human ambition, quite in the spirit of that true poetry
which embraces the whole range of human existence;<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
and thirdly, another kind of episode which introduces
the giant Adamastor, whom Camoens conjured up from
the old world of fable to render him the spirit of the
Cape of Good Hope.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> In the description of this part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
of the voyage, Camoens for the first time uses the
freedom of relieving the solemn seriousness of his
narrative by some comic touches. Fernaõ Velloso is
the humourist among the enterprising followers of Vasco
da Gama.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> Camoens also occasionally breaks the poetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
tone of the whole description by a display of his
mythological and historical pedantry, and by his endeavours
to express in a poetic manner things which
are totally unpoetic; as for example, in alluding to the
day of the departure of the fleet, he says:&mdash;“When
the eternal orb of light had entered the sign of the
Nemæan monster, and when the decaying world in
its sixth age, moved feebly and slowly after having
observed the sun’s circuitous course repeated fourteen
hundred and ninety-seven times.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> These deformities
sometimes injure the beauty of the finest parts of the
poem.</p>

<p>The chief portion of the second half of the poem,
from the sixth to the tenth canto, is thrown into shade
by the first half; and the essential want of a rising
interest, weakens the epic character of the whole.
But these last five cantos of the Lusiad abound in
classically beautiful passages; and that kind of unity
at which the poet aimed is on no occasion forgotten.
The description of the palace of Neptune and the sea
deities in the depths of the ocean is equally charming
and novel; though it must be allowed that the portrait
of Triton degenerates into the grotesque. In order to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
omit no opportunity of interweaving into the composition
of the Lusiad whatever might shed a poetic
lustre on the Portuguese name, Camoens makes Velloso,
for the amusement of the ship’s crew, relate the history
of the Lusitanian knights, who according to Portuguese
tradition, are called <i>Os doze de Inglaterra</i> (the twelve
of England.) In the description of the storm which
follows, the powerful painting of the dreadful picture
once more reveals the poet who had himself passed
through like scenes of danger. The same stamp of
truth is apparent in the succeeding descriptions of
Indian objects, which no great poet, except Camoens,
has sketched from nature. The poem is not injured
by the long and energetic apostrophe to the European
powers, with which the seventh canto commences.
According to the view to be taken by a catholic
christian, Camoens was justified in extolling the national
glory of Portugal above that of other christian
nations, on the ground that while the Portuguese by
their valour, were extending the dominion of the
catholic faith, and had not, for a considerable period
waged war against any of the European states, those
states were contending against each other, and even in
a certain measure against the church of Rome. To
strengthen in some degree the poetic probability by a
matter of fact, Camoens has introduced, at the period
when the intercourse between the Portuguese and the
Indian Prince of Calecut commences, a Moor named
Monzayde, whose destiny had actually conducted him
over land to India. Through this mediator, who speaks
Spanish, and who finally becomes a christian, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
Indians are made acquainted with the power of the
Portuguese and Spanish arms. This Moor is also the
interpreter, who, in the eighth canto assists Paulo da
Gama in explaining the historical pictures and embroideries
to the Indian ambassador. In point of poetic
merit, this supplement to the abstract of the history of
Portugal is far inferior to the narrative in the third and
fifth cantos:&mdash;but Camoens could find no other means
of accomplishing his purpose; for he was equally reluctant
to omit anything which he conceived to belong
to his pictures of Portuguese national glory, or to
crowd too many of the events of former times into
one part of his poem. None of these historical descriptions,
which occupy a large portion of the eighth
canto, form finished pictures; they are mere sketches, and
are, in general, deficient in poetic warmth; but the ninth
canto makes ample amends for this fault. The magic
festival, which Venus prepares to recreate her beloved
navigators after the fatigues they have encountered, is
boldly conceived and charmingly executed; and in this
part of the composition the poet’s fancy has revelled
with evident delight. Camoens, like all the Portuguese
poets of his age, next to the indulgence of heroic feeling
and all powerful patriotism, was fond of luxuriantly
pourtraying the passion of love. Except the fate of
Inez de Castro, and the atchievements of Nuno Alvarez
Pereira at the battle of Aljubarota, the poet has executed
no portion of his poem with such decided predilection
as the visit of the navigators to the enchanted
island; and to no other part of the poem is so much
space allotted in proportion to the whole. The long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
description of the preparations for the luxuriant festival,
and of the festival itself, which commences at the
eighteenth stanza of the ninth, and extends into the
tenth canto, is full of picturesque beauty. Its great
prolixity however, must, even according to the incorrect
plan which Camoens followed, be accounted a
defect in the composition. But the reader, like the poet
himself, soon forgets every thing except the seductive
painting, which sometimes, it must be confessed, only
just respects the boundaries of decorum, which yet upon
the whole offends no elevated feeling, and which has
not been surpassed by any later poet in the same style.
The first idea of the island of love, on which Camoens
makes Venus entertain the Portuguese navigators, seems
borrowed from Ariosto, but Ariosto’s description of the
magic gardens of Alcina scarcely affords a groundwork
for the scenes and situations in the Lusiad. There is,
however, little room to doubt that Tasso, when he trod
in Ariosto’s footsteps in order to describe the abode of
Armida, availed himself of the description of Camoens.
In the tone of frank simplicity with which the festival is
announced, the character of the poet is again manifested.
It is described as merely “a refreshment for restoring
the exhausted strength of the navigators; some interest
for those fatigues which render short life still
shorter.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> Venus, in her car drawn by doves, descends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
from Mount Ida in quest of Cupid. She finds him with
a throng of loves employed in forging arrows. The
fuel used in the process of forging is allegorically and
whimsically described to be human hearts, and the red-hot
arrows are cooled in tears. Cupid and his little
deputies are directed to wound a number of goddesses
and sea nymphs, so that every individual on board
Vasco da Gama’s fleet, shall on landing on the magic
island, find himself in the situation of a happy lover.
Meanwhile Venus adorns the island with the loveliest
charms of nature.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> On first landing, the navigators
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
know not where they are, but they are soon satisfied
with the pleasing reality without concerning themselves
about the nature of the miracle which has transported
them to a terrestrial heaven.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> When the festival is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
drawing to a close, the poet for the first time explains
the object of the fiction, by stating it to be an allegorical
representation of the happiness which is the
reward of courage and virtue. After this cold manner
of dissolving the enchantment, the unprejudiced reader
feels little interest in the conclusion of the poem. The
stanzas in which the prophetic nymph celebrates the
future atchievements of the Portuguese are historical
fragments, the connection of which must be studied in
order to form a just estimate of their poetic merits and
demerits. The geographic supplement which is put into
the mouth of Thetis is still colder, notwithstanding the
singular idea of the globe which hovers in the air, and
which exalts the miracle of the geographic lecture. But
thus is the sympathy of the reader the more powerfully
excited by the passage towards the end of the Lusiad,
where Camoens speaks of himself; which he had refrained
from doing in the preceding part of the work.
As he approached the close of his labour he was
impressed with the conviction that no earthly happiness
awaited him; and now saw “his years descending,
and the transition from summer to autumn near
at hand; his genius frozen by the coldness of fate,
and he himself borne down by sorrow into the stream
of black oblivion and eternal sleep.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> His heart then
pours fourth the epiphonema of the poem, consisting of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
a didactic apostrophe to his sovereign, full of loyalty,
but not less abounding in honest zeal for truth, justice
and virtue.</p>

<p>An epic poem so powerfully imbued with intensity
of feeling and character as the Lusiad, naturally calls
to mind Dante’s <i>Divina Comedia</i>, and Klopstock’s Messiah.
But the Lusiad bears in other respects no more
resemblance to the Messiah, than to every other great
poem in which the beauties make amends for the exercise
of indulgence towards numerous faults. The
Lusiad presents a greater similarity to the work of
Dante. Both poems are epic, though neither are
epopees in the strict sense of the term. Both are
singular, but truly poetic in invention; and in both the
full stream of purest poetry is incessantly broken by
false learning and various unpoetic excrescences. But
with respect to invention the Divina Comedia is, in its
original plan, trivial, and only becomes grand by the
poetic filling up of the vast divisions of hell, purgatory
and heaven: the Lusiad is more poetic in its outline,
but not so rich in its internal parts. Finally, the two
poems are distinguished by the kind of feeling which
prevails in each and by a total difference of style.
Dante introduced all the variety of the terrestrial
world, of which he had perfect command, into the
mystic region of a celestial and subterraneous existence,
in which he, as a Christian, placed faith; and the whole
plan of his extraordinary poem has for its object the
pious apotheosis of his beloved Beatrice. Camoens
glowed with patriotism and heroism; and to avoid
weakening the patriotic and nationally heroic character
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
of his poem, by the force of religious interest, he preferred
introducing into his terrestrial fiction the heaven
of mythology, because he felt that it afforded him the
finest imagery. Dante’s style is throughout energetic,
frequently rude, and always characteristic of the spirit
of the extraordinary writer, who stood alone, and who
in a great measure himself created the language in
which he expressed his feelings. Camoens, like Ariosto,
was wholly the man of his age and his country; a
fact which is sufficiently evident from the delicate and
luxuriant style, which he partly borrowed from Ariosto,
and which he only cultivated as far as was necessary
for the expression of the serious epopæia.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p id="The_other_184">The other poetic works of Camoens, appeared even
in the eyes of the poet himself, when compared with
the Lusiad, merely secondary effusions of his feelings
and his imagination. It appears, as far as the point
can be ascertained, that he never collected them himself,
and many may therefore be lost. Among those
productions which were collected and published after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
the death of Camoens, by his admirer Lobo de Soropita,
under the affected title of <i>Rhythmas</i>, there are several
which were not printed from the best and latest copies.
Some other poems which escaped the notice of the first
collectors, and which have only been included by modern
writers among the miscellaneous productions of Camoens,
may be found in a somewhat different form among the
poems of the pious Diogo Bernardes. This writer, who
was a contemporary and admirer of Camoens, and who
was the first among the celebrated Portuguese poets of
that age, to render justice to the preponderating genius
of the author of the Lusiad, is now, in spite of all his
piety, accused of gross plagiarism on that author.
The writer of a general history of modern poetry and
eloquence has, however, no occasion to take part in the
controversy respecting these problematic works; for
none of the disputed poems are of a kind which was
new in Portuguese literature; and among the miscellaneous
remains of Camoens are many pieces of similar
species, the authenticity of which is undisputed.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p>But the miscellaneous poems of Camoens, are calculated
to involve the literary historian in another kind
of embarrassment. They are, if not extremely numerous,
at least sufficiently various; and among the number
are many so poetically conceived, and admirably
executed, that to give merely to one of each class of
these minor poems that kind of detailed consideration
which it has been thought necessary to bestow on the
Lusiad, would be to incur the risk of converting the
history of Portuguese poetry into a compendium of the
history of the poetic works of Camoens. In every species
of poetic composition then practised in Portugal,
Camoens has left specimens of no common merit; and
in some of those species his example has formed and
fixed the favourite style for his native country. Indeed
a careful perusal of the various productions of the author
of the Lusiad, is alone sufficient to afford a summary
notion of the whole range of Portuguese poetry
in the sixteenth century. This will account for the
preponderating authority still conceded to the works of
this poet in the polite literature of his country. To that
authority Portuguese critics and writers are always disposed
to defer in discussing the merits of any poem;
and when they wish to select a model in any particular
kind of poetic composition, they invariably turn first to
the works of Camoens. The predilection of the Portuguese
for the greatest of their poets, has rendered them
unjust towards the merits of others who have not chosen
to compose in his manner. But in the poetry of Camoens
the national style is combined with correctness and elegance,
precisely in the manner which suited the taste
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
of his country: and Portuguese taste has never risen
above the degree of cultivation to which Camoens attained.</p>

<p id="His_sonnets_187">In sonnets the fancy of Camoens was particularly
prolific. Like Tasso, he seems throughout the whole of
his life to have made it a rule to compose sonnets as
long as he could compose verse. The number of his
sonnets which have been preserved is three hundred and
one. Some appear to be occasional sonnets; and of
these several are written in fictitious names. It is
known that, in India, Camoens was frequently applied
to for poetic aid in affairs of the heart; for according
to the spirit of the age a lover could not more elegantly
recommend himself to the good graces of a fair lady
than by the composition of a tender sonnet; and a
poet, like Camoens, who was himself so often poetically
occupied with his amatory feelings, would find but little
difficulty in celebrating another lady besides his own
mistress. Most of his sonnets have love for their
theme, and they are of very unequal merit: some are
full of Petrarchic tenderness and grace, and moulded
with classic correctness; others are impetuous and romantic,
or disfigured by false learning, or full of tedious
pictures of the conflicts of passion with reason. Upon
the whole, however, no Portuguese poet has so correctly
seized the character of the sonnet as Camoens. Without
apparent effort, merely by the ingenious contrast of
the first eight with the six last fines, he knew how to
make these little effusions convey a poetic unity of ideas
and impressions, after the model of the best Italian sonnets,
in so natural a manner, that the first lines or quartets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
of the sonnet excite a soft expectation, which is
harmoniously fulfilled by the tercets or six last lines.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>
In this way he has occasionally imparted a romantically
beautiful effect to well known stories in the sonnet
form, by the introduction of a single tender idea at the
close.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> Among these sonnets there are likewise some
of a moral and religious character.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p id="His_cancoes_189">In the series of the minor poems of Camoens, the
sonnets are succeeded by seventeen <i>Canções</i> (songs)
written on the model of Petrarch’s canzoni. These
compositions more particularly prove how deeply Camoens
was penetrated with the spirit of the Petrarchic
poetry. They also display the utmost elegance of language,
combined with the soft harmony of the Italian
verse.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> In these canções, as well as in the other poems
of Camoens, the painting of natural scenery, wherever
the lyric picture embraces it, presents a character of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
lively perception, which never could be imitated in the
closet by any laboured exercise of the imagination.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p id="His_odes_190">The canções are followed by twelve compositions
styled odes. In their essential characteristics, these pieces
are but little distinguished from the canções, though the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
object of the poet seems to have been that they should
approximate more nearly to the ancient style. The
structure of the verse corresponds with that which
Ferreira and the Spanish poets, since the time of Luis
de Leon, selected for this class of lyric composition.
The bold fancy of Pindar, or the energy of Horace, is
not to be expected in these any more than other Portuguese
and Spanish odes. But Camoens never limited
his poetry merely to sonorous language. The first
ode is particularly distinguished for its beauty. It is
addressed to the moon. The idea is mythological, like
all the lofty ideas of Camoens. But in none of his
other odes has the poet so well succeeded in combining
the grace of antiquity with a romantic tenderness of
feeling free from every trace of affectation. The commencement
is in the pure ode style. The poet invokes
his muse to stem “the current of lovers’ tears, and attired
in a rich and gay robe to do homage to the
goddess who converts night into day.” He then
addresses the goddess of the moon herself, she “whose
silver beam penetrates the thick clouds, and prevents
night from obscuring the image which love traces and
re-traces in his heart; she whose pure forehead is
crowned and encircled with stars; she who strews the
plains with roses and with flowers, created by spring
through her heavenly influence.”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> But a still finer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
passage occurs at the conclusion of the ode, where the
poet bids farewell to night, “the silent friend whom
he obeys; and, that she may listen to his complaints,
presents to her roses and fresh amaranth still wet with
the tears of the fair bride of the jealous Titan.”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p id="His_elegies_192">The odes are followed by some <i>Sextinas</i>, the
artificial beauty of which Camoens has not failed to
render pleasing. His one-and-twenty elegies are, however,
more worthy of particular attention. Next to the
Lusiad these compositions may in general be numbered
among the longer poems of the author, and also among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
those in which the poet is most frequently represented
in his real character as a man. Camoens had, however,
no correct notion of the elegiac style. Like Ferreira,
he blended it with the epistolary. But such a junction is
no less detrimental to the tenderness than to the unity
of the elegiac character, and in general deprives elegy
of half its poetic interest. Were the language less copious
and facund, this method of confounding the boundaries
of the elegiac and the epistolary styles, would be
still more striking. But the harmonious softness and rich
flow of the expression, even where it approaches to prolixity,
establish, at least, in a certain degree, a unity of
character among the heterogeneous ingredients of which
the elegy of Camoens is composed.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> The feeble and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
tedious passages are readily overlooked, as they are
amply counterbalanced by others possessing real elegiac
beauty:<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> and the occasional deficiencies of these elegies
in the poetry appropriate to their class, are compensated
by the inappropriate, in which the poetic character of
Camoens is every where prominent. The romantic soul
of the unfortunate poet is completely unveiled in his
elegiac compositions. His earliest productions in this
class were written in his youth, when he was exiled to
Belem; the others are expressive of the feelings which
he experienced in his oriental voyages and adventures.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
There he fondly cherished recollections of the tranquil
happiness which he persuaded himself he had enjoyed
in his native country, though he had indignantly abandoned
it as a place to existence in which he could not
be reconciled. The common fate of humanity, which,
independently of his personal circumstances, he always
viewed profoundly and poetically, was in India more
than ever present to his imagination; and in his elegies
he has poured forth, without restraint, all the feelings
of his heart. Thus is sympathy more powerfully
excited by these compositions than by many of the
same class, the beauties of which are of a less prosaic
character. No other works of the poet so irresistibly
command the reader’s regret for his misfortunes, and
love for him as a man.</p>

<p id="His_estancias_195">A few poems, widely differing from each other in
character, are printed under the common title of <i>estancias</i>,
(stanzas) because they are all composed in Italian
octaves. Camoens seems to have felt that in Portuguese,
as in Italian, this measure was, in universality of
application, nearly equivalent to the Greek hexameter,
because it was capable of being united and blended
with most of the romantic poetic forms, in the same
manner as that hexameter with the different styles of
ancient poetry. The three first poems which occur
under the title of <i>estancias</i>, are truly poetic epistles,
and at the same time faithful mirrors of the character
and principles of the poet. Through them Camoens, in
a spirit of fervent loyalty, but with a no less honest
zeal for truth and justice, addresses useful advice to his
sovereign. The estancias which immediately succeed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
these epistles, are glosses in the Spanish manner on two
of the author’s own sonnets. A tender epistle addressed
to a lady, is the subject of the next: and the last estancias
form an epic legend, which, with some alterations,
also appears among the works of Bernardes. It
is founded on the history of St. Ursula. Whether this
epic legend be really the production of Camoens, or of
his admirer Bernardes, it far excels Ferreira’s similar
talc of St. Colomba, though the materials are less
poetic.</p>

<p id="His_eclogues_196">Among the miscellaneous poems of Camoens, the
eclogues occupy a considerable space, particularly if we
include those of which Bernardes claimed to be the author.
Much care appears to have been taken to give
them an elegant polish. By the Portuguese they are
regarded as models; and according to the received idea
of the modern eclogue, particularly in Spain and Portugal,
they certainly deserve that distinction. But with
all their unquestionable merits, they do not reach the
pure eclogue style of Saa de Miranda. The rural character
which they ought to possess, is besides much
impaired, in consequence of Camoens having, like Ferreira,
employed the bucolic form merely to give a poetic
interest to events borrowed from real life. This indeed
was a custom which had been more or less followed in
Portuguese poetry since the time of Ribeyro, and of
which even Saa de Miranda did not disdain to avail
himself. But those Portuguese poets who endeavoured
to form their eclogue style after Saa de Miranda, were
in general content with pastoral names and pastoral
scenes, when they wished to throw a bucolic disguise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
over known characters and events; and thus the spirit
of pastoral poetry often entirely vanished in those compositions
in which its form was most ostentatiously
displayed. The eclogues of Camoens partake of this
essential fault. Still, however, they are sufficiently
pleasing even without the aid of the historical key,
with which the reader would doubtless willingly dispense.
The descriptive passages are in general the best.
In the expression of sentiment these eclogues perfectly
resemble the sonnets, canções, and similar poems with
which in reality they constitute one species. Passages
in the Spanish language are occasionally interspersed.</p>

<p id="His_poems_197">In the collected works of Camoens, a separation
is made of his poems in the Italian style and
the Italian syllabic measure, from those which are
composed in redondilhas, and which afford examples
of an improved national style. In this style also he
has enriched every species of poetic composition practised
in Portugal and Spain. Much and justly
celebrated are the redondilhas in which he poured
forth the inmost feelings of his soul, on his return
from Macao to Goa, after he had narrowly escaped death
by shipwreck.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> The number of his smaller poems, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
all the possible forms of the old lyric style, proves how
much, as a poet, he was attached to his native country.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
Romantic, gallant and comic plays of fancy and wit,
glossed mottos in the Spanish style, voltas<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> in the
genuine Portuguese manner, and other poetic trifles in
the Portuguese and Spanish languages, appear to have
been dealt out at every opportunity with a profuse
hand by Camoens. In these compositions he paid no
rigid attention to the correctness and elegance of the
ideas, and indeed no mental sport of this kind seems to
have been too homely for him. He even composed in
honour of a lady, a romantic mythological <i>a b c</i> in
redondilhas, in which, in correspondence with the
initial letters, the names Artemisia, Cleopatra, Dido,
Eurydice, Phædra, (spelt Fedra, according to the
Italianized orthography of Camoens) Galatæa, &amp;c. are
played on in succession. But in some of these compositions,
the simplicity and amenity of the old lyric
style are combined with a peculiar grace, which
alternately defies<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> and disarms<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> the severity of criticism.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p id="His_dramas_200">The same national spirit which prevented the
patriotic Camoens from rejecting the old lyric forms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
of the Portuguese poetry, induced him to write several
dramas, and thus to leave no kind of poetic composition
unattempted. It is not known at what period of his
life these dramatic works were produced; but it is
probable that they were written previously to his departure
for India. They belong more completely to
the age of Camoens than to the poet himself. They
are, however, highly deserving of attention, though they
should be merely considered as the last proofs of the
poetic versatility and plastic genius of an author who
comprised his whole age within himself, as far as a
Portuguese national poet could accommodate himself to
his age. Camoens was too much a poet to wish to
supplant the national drama of his native country,
however rude it then might be, by a prosaically
modelled imitation of the ancient drama. He adhered to
the party formed by the Spanish dramatist Naharro,
and his ingenious countryman Gil Vicente. But his
determination to dramatic poetry was not sufficiently
decided to enable him to fix, by his productions, the
taste of the Portuguese nation. Had the genius which
animates the Lusiad, taken a dramatic direction, Camoens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
would have been the Calderon of Portugal, before a
Lope de Vega had arisen in Spain. But Camoens
in the composition of his dramas contented himself
with slightly overstepping the bounds of Gil Vicente’s
manner, and with refining, also, only in a slight degree,
the construction of the plot and the language. The
rudest of the three dramas, which are now attached as
a supplement to the other works of the author, is,
<i>El Rey Seleuco</i>, (King Seleucus) a singular production,
founded on the well known anecdote of the history of
that monarch, who resigned his wife Stratonice to his
son Antiochus, lest the youth should fall a sacrifice to
the passion of love. Camoens seems to have had no
idea of treating this delicate subject in a sentimental
way. The burlesque prelude or prologue, as it is called,
in prose, is calculated to raise the expectation of a farce
rather then of a serious drama. The theatrical manager,
a lad who acts as his servant, a man of condition, who
presents himself as a spectator, and his <i>escudeiro</i>, (attendant)
are the characters in this prologue. The
manager’s servant is the <i>gracioso</i> of the piece, and his
jokes are at least so far useful that they afford an idea
of the kind of wit which was at that time relished by the
fashionable world in Lisbon. The drama itself, to which
this prologue is the introduction, is entitled a comedy
in the Spanish acceptation of the term, and is likewise
denominated an <i>auto</i>, probably because royal personages
are brought upon the scene, a circumstance which according
to the Portuguese notions of poetry in that
age elevated the piece above a mere comedy. The
historical material is moulded according to the romantic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
forms; the composition is not only inartificial but
trivial; and in the execution the ludicrous is quite as
prevalent as the comic. The king and queen first
enter, to converse on the melancholy state of the
prince, and the king takes the opportunity of lamenting
that he is no longer young enough for so fair a consort.
The prince next appears attended by his pages, to
whom he complains of his passion, but without naming
the beloved object. The king and queen in vain endeavour
to ascertain the cause of the prince’s grief, and
orders are given to prepare a bed for him. A bed is
introduced on the stage, and a chamber-maid who is
engaged in making it, is surprised by her lover in
disguise, who is a <i>porteiro</i> (usher) of the castle. This
scene is altogether an interlude in the romantic style.
The prince again enters, and after many tender complaints
betakes himself to bed. A band of music arrives
to sooth him while he reposes. One of the musicians
named Alexander de Fonseca, enters into conversation
with the usher and a page, concerning the melancholy
of the prince. With the consent of the prince the
usher sings a romance, and the queen again enters with
an attendant. Various scenes thus succeed each other,
until the physician by feeling the prince’s pulse, discovers
the secret. The catastrophe is merely a representation
of the dose of the anecdote, without any reference to
the queen, who is resigned by the father to the son,
like an article of household furniture. The physician
in this comedy is a Spaniard. He is made a native of
Castile in order that one of the characters might speak
Spanish, and thus introduce a variety into the dialogue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
which it appears was agreeable to a Lisbon audience.
The dialogue is in other respects natural, and the
versification in redondilhas is pleasing and not devoid
of elegance. But there is not a single excellent scene
to compensate for the grotesque frivolity of the composition.
It is impossible to consider this work as any
thing else than a mere juvenile essay of such a poet as
Camoens.</p>

<p>The second comedy of Camoens, <i>Os Amphitryões</i>,
(the Amphitryons), was, however, a valuable contribution
to the dramatic literature of Portugal. The
merit of the invention of this purely comic piece,
belongs indeed to Plautus, whose Amphitryon Camoens
has freely imitated. But even the imitation must have
marked an epoch in the history of the dramatic literature
of Portugal, had the public been inclined to favour
so happy a combination of the national and ancient
forms. Any one unacquainted with the Amphitryon
of Plautus would regard the Portuguese comedy as an
original. The whole story of the piece is modernized
without weakening the comic force of the situations.
Jupiter indeed remains unchanged; but Mercury who
attends him in his disguise, performs the servant in the
true Portuguese style. Amphitryon is a sea captain,
according to the Portuguese idea of that character.
The servant of Amphitryon is converted into a perfect
gracioso, who speaks Spanish, but still retains the name
of Sosia. The humour of the burlesque scenes in which
Sosia appears, is heightened by making Mercury, who
converses with Jupiter in Portuguese, always speak
Spanish, when he plays his part as the pseudo Sosia.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
It would be worth while to ascertain whether this
pleasant comedy is ever performed in Lisbon.</p>

<p><i>Filodemo</i>, the third comedy of Camoens, is one of
those dramatized novels, of which the Spanish theatre
afterwards afforded many examples. It is not a drama
of intrigue, but a variegated collection of grave and
half comic scenes, which are combined together as a
whole by their common reference to the result of a
singular event. That event is the saving of two twins,
a boy and a girl, whose mother is a princess of Denmark.
A shepherd finds the twins and brings them
up. Shepherds and shepherdesses, gentlemen and
ladies, a waiting woman, a hunter, and other characters
of a similar kind, form the romantic groupe. The
scene is sometimes in town in the open streets, or within
a house; sometimes in the country, and among barren
mountains. The denouement is the most trivial part
of the whole composition. It is brought about by a
shepherd initiated in the art of magic, who, by his necromantic
skill, discovers the parentage of the twins, and
by this discovery removes the obstacles which impede
the happy issue of two parallel love stories. In this
drama Camoens has interspersed, and evidently not
without design, scenes in prose among scenes in verse.
In conformity with his inclination to unite all manners,
he was desirous of approximating to the party, which
on the pretext of adhering strictly to nature endeavoured
to banish verse from Portuguese comedy. He accordingly
gives the dialogue in prose where the conversation
is entirely of a popular character; and whenever the
style becomes somewhat elevated, redondilhas are again
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
introduced. Some of the shepherds speak Spanish,
and among them a lad who is the <i>bobo</i> (buffoon) of the
piece. Thus it would appear that Camoens in all his
dramas, sought to exercise the right of retaliation
upon the Spanish poets, who were fond of making their
<i>gracioso</i>, or buffoon, express himself in Galician or Portuguese.
The jokes in the Spanish language which
Camoens has in this instance put into the mouth of his
gracioso, would be sufficiently unpolished even if they
were less broad and spiritless.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>


<h3>MONTEMAYOR.</h3>

<p>From Camoens, whose name now becomes a waymark
for the whole domain of Portuguese poetry, the
historian of that poetry cannot properly revert to the
classic school of Ferreira, without previously reviving
the recollection of Jorge de Montemayor, who was a
contemporary of Camoens and Ferreira. The history
of the life and writings of this excellent poet, belongs
indeed rather to the literature of Spain than to that of
Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> But the spirit of the pastoral romance of
Diana, by which Montemayor gained immortal fame, is
in fact the spirit of Portuguese poetry transfused into
the Spanish language. Without being an imitator of
Ribeyro,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> Montemayor followed in the same path with
the same kind of susceptibility to impressions. But
the cultivated delicacy of his feeling, and the romantic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
enthusiasm of his imagination, rendered him the first
poet who enlarged and dignified the plain antiquated
form of the Portuguese pastoral romance. He renewed
and riveted the old link of connection between the
Spanish and the Portuguese poetry. Had he confined
himself to writing in his native tongue, he would probably
have been succeeded by a Portuguese Gil Polo;<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>
and the romantic pastoral poetry of the Portuguese
would then have remained single in its kind. But Montemayor
composed verses in the Portuguese language
only for the sake of variety, and not with the view of
extending the sphere of Portuguese poetry.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>


<h3 id="Classical_school_208">CLASSICAL SCHOOL OF SAA DE MIRANDA AND
ANTONIO FERREIRA.</h3>

<p>The comparatively correct style of poetry introduced
into Portuguese literature by Saa de Miranda, and the
still more coldly correct style of Antonio de Ferreira,
though favoured by that portion of the polite world
which valued a reputation for learning, were but little
esteemed by the great bulk of the public. The poets
of this sect may fairly be said to constitute a classical
school, without thereby admitting them to an
equal rank with the incorrect men of genius whose
irregular effusions could scarcely fail to possess more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
poetic character, than other works which are now to
be noticed; such, for example, as the poems of Andrade
Caminha, who formed himself entirely on the model of
Ferreira. The efforts made by the poets of this classic
school to attain the correctness of the ancients seem to
have checked their powers of fancy, and it may be presumed
that imaginations which were so easily repressed,
could not be very creative and energetic. Those who,
like some modern German writers would, in defiance of
every rule of language, render genius the measure of
classic excellence, must find a new term to designate
that poetry, the greatest merit of which is the elegant
perfection and pure rounding of poetic forms after the
example of the ancients. This, which is in other respects
an inferior style of poetry, is nevertheless held in consideration
by all cultivated nations. To reject it as
altogether worthless would indeed be very unjust, since
it serves to shew how judgment, talent, and taste, can
by the study of ancient models, produce, even without
the aid of genius, a certain kind of poetic beauty,
which is not unmeritorious, though it frequently presents
scarcely a shadow of that pure and sublime
beauty which is the offspring of real genius. Poetry
of this kind is therefore styled classical, merely in
reference to a certain degree of affinity which its forms
bear to the classical forms of Greek and Roman art.</p>


<h3 id="Andrade_Caminha_209">ANDRADE CAMINHA.</h3>

<p>One of the warmest friends, admirers and imitators
of Ferreira, was Pedro de Andrade Caminha, <i>Camareiro</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
(gentleman of the chamber) at the court of the Infante
Dom Duarte, brother to King John III. He survived
his friend Ferreira six-and-twenty years. During his
life his poems seem rather to have been esteemed by a
small circle of connoisseurs and dilettanti, than to have
been favourites with the public. Thus it happened
that at that period they were only circulated in manuscript,
and that afterwards, with the exception of a few
which had been admitted into spiritual collections, they
totally disappeared; they have, however, been recently
discovered, and have been printed at the expense of the
Portuguese Royal Society.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> Andrade Caminha seems
to have had no notion of any thing more perfect in
poetic composition than the works of his friend Ferreira,
who, however, barely avoided the dangerous boundary
where poetry ends and versified prose begins. Caminha’s
compositions in elegant verse are, however, still more
deficient in genuine poetry, than the works of Ferreira,
and indeed they can scarcely be termed poems. His
eclogues are cold, and their coldness is the more striking,
as they are intended to express forcibly the language of
romantic love. His epistles are better deserving of
attention. They possess just about as much poetic
warmth as is necessary to maintain the character of
didactic poems. In these epistles Caminha, as a painter
of manners and a moralist, alternately describes and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
reasons energetically and without pedantry in the style
of Ferreira, and his unassuming manner gives more
effect to the agreeable colouring of that style.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> But
Andrade Caminha is by no means so rich in ideas as
Ferreira. He limits the circle of his free reflections,
by constant reference to the relations in which he
lived. In the epistles to his brother, and in those to
Ferreira, he, however, indulges in a more unconstrained
expression of feeling.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> Of all these epistles,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
the seventeenth, in which he inveighs against impertinent
critics, possesses most didactic merit.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> Andrade
Caminha seems to have supposed that he possessed
a particular talent for elegiac poetry. Twenty of the
elegies he composed are still preserved, exclusive of
many songs of complaining love in redondilhas, to which
the title of elegies is likewise given. But the sorrow
for the death of the royal personages and ingenious
friends, which is lavished in the first half of Caminha’s
elegies, and the tender anguish occasioned by the inexorableness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
of his beloved Phyllis, which appears in
the second half, seldom rouses any poetic sympathy in
the reader, notwithstanding the beauty of language with
which the sorrow and anguish are expressed. In some
of the elegies to Phyllis, the descriptions of natural
scenery possess considerable merit.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p>But the most remarkable of all Caminha’s works are
his epitaphs and epigrams, of which no Portuguese poet
has bequeathed so many to posterity. His <i>Epitafios</i>
which amount to eighty-one, and his <i>Epigrammas</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
which exceed two hundred and fifty in number, are
almost all written in octave verse. In these little
pictures of reflection and sentiment, which derive so
much of their value from correctness and elegance, a
limited fancy aided by solid taste is capable of rising
above the level of prose. The labour which Andrade
Caminha bestowed on the composition of his epitaphs
and epigrams, sufficiently proves that he felt what was
his proper vocation at the foot of Parnassus. But even
there he could not travel without a guide, and the spirit
of his age induced him to choose Ausonius for his conductor.
He had, like Ausonius, sufficient talent for
the proper keeping of the tenderness, precision and
energy which distinguish the serious epigram of the
Greeks; but in his imitation of the style of the Greek
epigram, he missed the refined correctness of Ausonius
by confounding poetic with prosaic simplicity. Of
the eighty-one epitaphs which Caminha composed in
honour of celebrated and exalted individuals, not one
can claim an equal rank with the best ancient productions
of the same kind. In most of them the
reader finds only dry encomiums accompanied by trivial
reflections.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> In others the ideas rise but very little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
above the level of the commonest observation.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> In
Caminha’s epitaphs the result of the epigrammatic
compound of the ideas, where he wishes to be uncommon,
has sometimes a singularly frigid effect; as,
for example, when speaking of the hero Affonso d’Albuquerque,
he pompously says: “He sprang from kings,
he honoured kings, and he subdued kings.”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> Even the
language of powerful feeling sinks, as in the epitaph on
Ferreira, beneath the common place of the reflections.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
The serious epigrams are more ingenious, though even
they are, for the most part, merely agreeable plays of
fancy.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> In some the formality of the diction produces
a very happy effect; in others the epigrammatic expression
of feeling displays an astonishing degree of
romantic intensity;<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> a few are truly excellent.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> To
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
this last class, however, the comic epigrams of Caminha
do not belong. A truly comic turn of thought is
scarcely ever to be found in them, and it is only
occasionally that they betray a poignant conceit.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> But
it must be acknowledged that a poet of more fertile
fancy would find it difficult to write nineteen strictly
comic epigrams on an ugly face, (<i>a uma feissima</i>.)</p>


<h3 id="Bernardes_217">BERNARDES.</h3>

<p>Diogo Bernardes was the friend of Andrade Caminha,
and like him an admirer and disciple of Ferreira. He
was capable of receiving more lively impressions than
Caminha, and he passed less tranquilly through life.
At first he only endeavoured to distinguish himself as
a poet, and he succeeded in gaining a degree of celebrity
in his native town Ponte de Lima, whence he is called
the poet of Lima. He then wished to become the
historian of his native country, but in this undertaking
he did not experience the support on which he had
calculated. It is probable that he became intimately
acquainted with Ferreira at the court of Lisbon.
Desirous of entering upon a life of active occupation,
he visited the court of Philip II. at Madrid, where he
resided for some time in quality of secretary to the
Portuguese embassy. Fate at length involved him in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
the unfortunate expedition of King Sebastian. After
fighting valiantly in the battle of Alcacer Seguer in
Africa, he was made prisoner by the victorious Moors.
During his captivity he composed several elegies and
spiritual songs. On recovering his freedom he returned
to his native country where he lived until the year
1596. Since his death he has been the object of severe
animadversion, owing particularly to the supposition,
which has already been noticed, of his having appropriated
to himself some poems of Camoens. But
were there no reason to doubt the fact of this
plagiarism, Bernardes has sufficiently suffered for
it in the esteem of posterity, by the unjust depreciation
of his poetic talent in the critical writings
of some Portuguese authors of the seventeenth century,
more particularly in those of Manoel de
Faria e Sousa, with whom this tone of criticism
originated. In the eighteenth century, however,
justice was rendered both to him and to Ferreira.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>
Without striking out a new course in poetry, and
indeed without paying any rigid regard to the distinction
between poetry and prose, Bernardes evinces a
far greater share of poetic feeling than Ferreira; and,
as a poet, if not as an elegant versifier, he is far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
superior to Andrade Caminha. His spiritual poems
are among the very best in the class to which they
belong. The title which he gave them, namely:&mdash;“Miscellaneous
poems to the good Jesus, and the glorious
Virgin his mother, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> is quite in the spirit of
the poetry of the catholic religion. But Bernardes was
not capable of viewing catholic Christianity on its only
true poetic side, that is to say, the bold character of a
miraculous working faith. He confined himself to the
representation of the inconceivable grace of the Saviour,
of the anguish of heart which the sinner should
feel in the deep consciousness of his unworthiness, and
of similar dogmata, which certainly may be expressed
in poetic phrases, but which unavoidably fetter the imagination,
and convert even hymns into litanies.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
only through a pious childishness of feeling, to which
catholic Christianity gives birth, that some portion of
poetic life has been imparted to the spiritual songs, sonnets,
and estancias of Bernardes. That feeling led
him to introduce into his sonnets to the holy virgin, a
mixture of romantic love; for example, when the poet
complains to the virgin that he loves something beside
herself;<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> or, when he admires her beauty in a picture,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
and reflects how beautiful she herself must be. The
spiritual songs in the popular style, which are included
among the works of Bernardes, are written in Spanish.
The temporal songs, elegies, and sonnets of this poet,
have the same soft and infantine character, and are
therefore not inappropriately presented to the public as
an appendix to his pictures of spiritual feeling.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> A
few elegies which he composed during his captivity
among the Moors,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> and some <i>endechas</i> in the old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
national style,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> belong to this class. Bernardes has also
left behind him eclogues, epistles, and numerous sonnets.
His epistles shew the veneration he entertained
for the critical judgment of Ferreira, whose cold style,
however, certainly could not please him.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> Many of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
sonnets are expressive of the homage with which he
submitted his poetry to the judgment of Ferreira, as
he did his faith to the doctrines of the church. The
elegy in which he laments the death of Ferreira may,
therefore, be numbered among his sincerest effusions of
the heart.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>


<h3 id="Cortereal_223">CORTEREAL.</h3>

<p>In the same school of correct poetry with Andrade
Caminha and Bernardes, arose the ingenious Jeronymo
Cortereal, another of those chivalrous spirits of the sixteenth
century, for whom every ordinary sphere of life
was too limited. Ambitious of doing honour to his
country and his distinguished family, he served in the
Portuguese army against the infidels in Asia and Africa.
He afterwards settled on his estate near Evora. In his
residence, which was situated on a hill, and surrounded
by rude precipices, and which commanded an extensive
view of the surrounding country, he devoted himself to
poetic composition; and sometimes, for the sake of
variety, turned his attention to music and painting.
This romantic abode of the muses charmed even the
cold-hearted Philip II. of Spain, when he visited his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
kingdom of Portugal. Cortereal, who on that occasion,
rendered homage to the new sovereign in verse,
had previously often been unfaithful to his native
tongue. He is included in the number of those Spanish
poets, who indefatigably but vainly vied with each
other to convert historical art into epic art, and to
produce a Spanish national epopee.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>&mdash;He related in
Spanish verse and in a poem of fifteen cantos, the
history of the battle of Lepanto, which has given
occasion to so much Spanish poetry of every description.
In the Portuguese language, he wrote two poems of a
similar kind, which, at the time of their production
were very much esteemed. The subject of one is the
siege of the Portuguese garrison of Diu in India,
which was valiantly defended by the Governor, Mascarenhas.
In the other of these works Cortereal relates
in the same style, the hapless story of Manoel de Souza
and his wife, who on their return from India were shipwrecked
on the coast of Africa, and who after wandering
about for a considerable time, perished among the
savages. To impart poetic decoration to prosaic events
of this kind, borrowed from the history of the period,
was the prevailing fashion of the day in Spain and
Portugal; and to banish such narrations from the
region of poetry, was an idea that never suggested
itself to any poet, still less to the public.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>


<h3 id="Other_Portuguese_poets_225">OTHER PORTUGUESE POETS OF THE SIXTEENTH
CENTURY&mdash;FERREIRA DE VASCONCELLOS; RODRIGUEZ
DE CASTRO; LOBO DE SOROPITA; &amp;c.</h3>

<p>Unconnected with this classical school, which became
extinct about the close of the sixteenth century, several
Portuguese poets pursued their own course, nearly in
the same manner as Camoens, though not with the same
success. Jorge Ferreira de Vasconcellos, for example,
a man of considerable acquirements, who held a distinguished
post in Lisbon, rendered himself celebrated
as the writer of several comedies which were much
esteemed. He was also the author of a new romance
of the Round Table.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>At a somewhat later period lived Estevam Rodriguez
de Castro, a poet, and at the same time a learned
physician, who was invited to Italy by the grand duke
of Tuscany. He is the author of various sonnets, odes
and eclogues.</p>

<p>Fernando Rodriguez Lobo de Soropita, the publisher
of the miscellaneous poems of Camoens, likewise
belongs to this age. Besides his juridical works, he
was the author of various pieces of humour in verse.</p>

<p>The present opportunity may be taken to mention
the latin verses, which were at this period still current
in Portugal, and by the composition of which, men of
education, and even men in office of the first rank,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
endeavoured to obtain a place near the ancient classics,
without interfering with the poets who adhered to their
vernacular tongue. The learned statesman Miguel de
Cabedo de Vasconcellos, who resided for several years
in France, was particularly distinguished as a writer of
latin verse. Ancient literature seems, at this time, to
have had a powerful influence on the education of the
Portuguese nobility; and as, at this period, all the
most celebrated Portuguese poets belonged to noble
families, it cannot be doubted that, the invisible link
between the Portuguese and latin poetry, was then
much stronger than the visible one, which never can
be mistaken in the works of these poets.</p>

<p>To enumerate the remaining names of the Portuguese
poets of the age of Camoens, is a task which
must be resigned to the writer, whose object it may be
to pursue more minutely the details of this particular
department of literature. Another Portuguese classic
of the sixteenth century, must, however, be included
among the number of those poets, who, in a general
history of modern poetry and eloquence, are the more
worthy to be placed in a conspicuous light, in proportion
as they are little celebrated beyond the confines of their
native land.</p>


<h3 id="Rodriguez_Lobo_226">RODRIGUEZ LOBO.</h3>

<p>That Portuguese writers, who, in other instances
have shewn themselves so careful in the collection of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
biographic details, should be almost silent respecting the
life of such a poet as Francisco Rodriguez Lobo, is a
circumstance only to be explained by one of those
sports of fortune, through which in literature, as in
life, honour is often withheld from the most deserving,
and lavished on the worthless. Rodriguez
Lobo was also a poet of noble extraction; but
nothing is known respecting the history of his life,
except that he was born in the town of Leiria, in Portuguese
Estremadura, about the middle of the sixteenth
century; that by talent and industry he distinguished
himself at the university, and afterwards spent the
chief portion of his life in the country; and finally,
that, in the passage of the Tagus, he perished in
that river which in his poetry he had often celebrated
in terms of romantic admiration. His remains were
interred in the chapel of a convent not far distant
from the spot, where the current of the stream cast
his body on shore.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p>To no other poet, after Saa de Miranda, Ferreira
and Camoens, are the language and literature of Portugal
so much indebted as to Rodriguez Lobo, with
whom, indeed, the history of Portuguese eloquence may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
be said to commence. He so highly improved romantic
prose in the Portuguese language, and laid so excellent
a foundation for a pure prose style, that in endeavouring
to attain classic perfection in that department of composition,
later writers have merely followed in the same
course. His verse is no way inferior to his prose; and
with all his classical refinement he was not, like Ferreira,
a poet of limited imagination. Of all the Portuguese
poets, Rodriguez Lobo is, in every respect, entitled to
the place next in rank to Saa de Miranda and Camoens.
His great erudition did not prevent him from being
completely imbued with poetic natural feeling, and in
pictures drawn from the romantic arcadian world his
fancy was inexhaustible. It is indeed only where his
descriptions have a pastoral colouring that he is perfectly
in his poetic sphere. But within that sphere he
occasionally draws resources from practical good sense
with a degree of adroitness which is displayed by no
previous Portuguese poet.</p>

<p>The writings of Rodriguez Lobo are susceptible of
three divisions which approximate to each other. To
the first belongs his prose work:&mdash;“the Court in the
Country,” in which no verses are introduced. Three
connected pastoral romances form the second and
most considerable portion; here the prose is merely a
beautiful combining link by which the work is made a
whole. The third comprises the author’s miscellaneous
poems.</p>

<p id="His_Court_228">The <i>Corte na Aldea, e Noites de Inverno</i>, (the
Court in the Country, and Winter Nights,) is the title
of a book, by which Rodriguez Lobo endeavoured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
to introduce a kind of Ciceronean style into Portuguese
prose, and at the same time to furnish a
useful guide to the formation of character for public
life. The antiquated style of the title is in a certain
degree at variance with the classic elegance of the
book itself. It is probable that no more in this, than
in his other works, would Rodriguez Lobo have
avoided the gothic ornaments of which the romantic
prose of the Spaniards and Portuguese was never
entirely divested, had he not, as a prose writer, been
here guided by his favourite Cicero, in whose footsteps
he trod. Perhaps he was also acquainted with some
Italian works of a similar kind; for at this period
the Italian prose writers imitated Cicero; and <i>Il
Cortegiano</i> of Castiglione, bears in its subject at
least a resemblance to Lobo’s “Court in the Country.”
But the direct imitation of Cicero’s style is unquestionably
an essential feature in this work. Precisely
with the same forms of friendly courtesy, as those
which characterize Cicero’s Tusculan and Academic
discourses, but with some romantic modifications, Rodriguez
Lobo collects around him a party of friends in
the country. These friends discourse together concerning
the proper education of an elegant man of the
world. As conversation occupies the chief portion of
the work, the whole is not inappropriately divided into
dialogues. Each dialogue has, however, an historical
frame work. But even though copying after Cicero’s
models, it appears, that Rodriguez Lobo could not, without
difficulty, find the path of pure prose composition.
The first dialogue opens precisely in the style of an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
old romance.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> Nevertheless the long sentence with which
it commences, bespeaks, by its facility and rhetorical harmony
a cultivation of style, which is not discoverable in
the works of any earlier Portuguese prose writer. At
the same time the reader is still farther charmed by the
delicate and sharp outline which is given of the characteristic
features of the assembled interlocutors.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> The conversation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
does not take the turn which might be expected;
but the natural colouring of the representation
is thus augmented. The degree of cultivation by which
these gentlemen are distinguished from the ordinary
portion of society, leads them, in the first place, to
discourse of literature. One of the party very properly
observes, that, the country library of a man of their
class, should consist chiefly of works on history, poetry,
and practical philosophy. This gives rise to an encomium
on the Portuguese language, which at that
period had to contend with enemies in its native
land, and which was still more vehemently attacked
by the Spaniards. Cultivation of language
again becomes the subject of discussion in these
dialogues; and the epistolary style being considered
more important than any other to a gentleman who is
to figure in the world, Rodriguez Lobo, through the
medium of one of the party, gives a full, and for the
age in which it was written, a new treatise of the art
of correct letter-writing. Even the external elegance
of the letter comes under consideration. The interlocutors
then discuss appointments, messages and
visits; ornamental hyperboles (<i>encarecimentos</i>); the
difference between love and desire; selfishness; social
decorum in manners and discourse; social eloquence
generally; the art of social anecdote in particular;
witty conversation in society; true gallantry (<i>cortesia</i>);
education at court, in the army and in the schools. The
reader who forms his judgment of this ingenious work,
apart from the age in which, and for which, it was
written, will probably depreciate its intrinsic merits.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
Now that the first principles of modern cultivation
have become common, the precepts of Rodriguez Lobo
will be scorned as trivial by the merest noviciates in politeness;
and our students of psychology will feel more
inclined to receive instructions from a French observer
of mankind of the eighteenth century, than from this
Portuguese writer. But in the sixteenth century such
a work as the <i>Corte na Aldea</i> could only have been
written by a man initiated in the refined manners of
his age, and combining a delicate spirit of observation
with an extraordinary store of literary knowledge. In
Portuguese eloquence it had no prototype. In the
descriptive passages only is the style somewhat overcharged
with antiquated and pompous phrases. The
turns of the dialogue are, like the similar passages in
the writings of Cicero, natural and pleasing, though
they do not possess the poignant spirit of more
recent productions of this kind.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> Where the exposition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
of the ideas assumes a totally didactic character, the
expression is clear, decided and unostentatiously harmonious.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a>
Upon the whole the prose of Rodriguez
Lobo has more of an oratorical character than the
modern style of conversation admits; but the romantic
tone of chivalrous gallantry in the sixteenth century,
produced, even in the conversational style, a certain formality
and rounding of long periods, by an influence
similar to that which the oratorical prose of the forum
exercised at Rome in Cicero’s time, over every species
of prosaic composition.</p>

<p>But Rodriguez Lobo’s <i>Corte na Aldea</i> is entitled to
honourable distinction, for even something more than its
general merits, as the first book in classical prose produced
in Portugal. By the anecdotes and tales which are interwoven
with the dialogue and didactic passages, it furnished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
the Portuguese with the first model of light narrative
style in their native tongue.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> The letters from the
Ciceronean collections, and other ancient and modern
works, which Rodriguez Lobo has translated, and introduced
as illustrations of his theory of the epistolary style,
are likewise very judiciously chosen. Finally, this copious
theory of epistolary composition is the first successful
attempt at any thing beyond a mere scholastic guide to
eloquence in Portuguese literature. Previously to the
production of this work, no rhetorical models were known
in Portugal, save those of Aristotle, which were transmitted
through the second and third hand in so barbarous
a form, that a writer found it necessary to forget them
in order to learn to express himself without pedantry.</p>

<p>Thus a Portuguese poet was the first who made his
countrymen acquainted with the spirit of genuine and
elegantly cultivated prose in their native tongue; and,
therefore, of all the writings of that poet, the work by
which he extended the boundary of the polite literature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
of his nation, deserves, in the history of that literature,
to hold the most conspicuous place. But Rodriguez
Lobo ranks still higher among poets than among prose
writers, though he neither introduced a new style nor
a new form of poetry into Portuguese literature. His
three connected <span id="His_pastoral_romances_235">pastoral romances</span>, are the most luxuriant
blossoms of this old branch of Portuguese poetry. Such
a treasure of romantic bucolics as the united works
present, is no where else to be found. The prose with
which Rodriguez Lobo has incorporated the pastoral
poems, can only be regarded as a poetic groundwork.
In the present age these romances would not easily
find, except in Portugal, and perhaps not even there,
a reader possessing sufficient patience to peruse them
throughout with attention. Were they even two thirds
shorter than they are, their monotony would still be intolerably
tiresome except to persons accustomed,&mdash;like
the polite world of Portugal and Spain, in the time of
Rodriguez Lobo,&mdash;to pastoralize their joys and sorrows,
and to be satisfied with the constant sameness of pastoral
composition, if it in some degree flatter the
heart and the senses. In describing the subject of this
romance, nothing further can be said, than that this or
that shepherd and shepherdess occasionally meet, and occasionally
separate. The general story unfolds no action
which excites particular interest; and as little do the
individual descriptions exhibit any character properly
fitted for originating action. It may with tolerable
certainty be inferred, that the story is a disguised
picture of the romantic events of real life, in which the
author was engaged. But though the disguises be less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
mysterious and singular than those of Ribeyro’s old
pastoral romance,<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> still they present not the slightest
attraction for posterity. If Lobo’s pastoral romance
be compared with Montemayor’s Diana, the monotony
of its subject will be found to be still more striking.
However, notwithstanding that monotony, and also
some ornamental excrescences of the old romantic
kind, this romance well merits literary distinction, on
account of the narrative and descriptive parts, which
combine the most pleasing polish of language with a
poetic tenderness of style, in which Lobo is not surpassed
by Montemayor himself. The descriptions of
scenery which frequently occur, are in particular remarkable
for exquisite touches of romantic simplicity.
They are, doubtless, sketched from nature: the
scene is invariably laid in Portugal, and the country is
sometimes accurately traced out by the rivers.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> But the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
parts in verse are by far the most beautiful of the
whole; and the best of the cantigas and canções which
occur in this delicate representation of romantic pastoral
life, may be regarded as classic models in their
kind.</p>

<p><i>Primavera</i> (Spring) is the title of the first of Lobo’s
pastoral romances. Pastoral images of spring are here
exhibited in contrast with the complaints of unhappy love.
The inexhaustible fertility which Rodriguez Lobo has
evinced in the execution of this contrast, seems totally
incredible in this prosaic age; for the same impressions
and situations are continually recurring in an ever varied
form. A descriptive song of spring, full of cheerfulness,
opens the beautiful gallery.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> The spirit of a shepherd,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
who has been transformed into a fountain, sings the history
of his tender passion. Sonnets, canções, tercets,
octaves, and redondilhas, are by turns gracefully introduced
in the succeeding cantos. Sometimes at the close
of these lyric effusions the reader is surprised by
ideas, which, however, were in some degree to be expected.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>
In general the enthusiasm of love is represented
with somewhat less quaintness by Rodriguez
Lobo than by Montemayor. When plays of sentiment
running through several stanzas turn on a prevailing
idea occurring in the last line of each stanza, Lobo, like
Montemayor, usually expresses this idea merely by a
simple exclamation. These plays of sentiment are also
very pleasingly combined with the usual reflections on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
the perishableness of all earthly things.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> The poetic salutations
to nature, which to the poet appeared as though
she sympathized with him, present, in this pastoral romance,
all the charm of the tenderest simplicity.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> Then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
again the same melancholy reflections recur in another
form.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> In many of these songs, however, the romantic
complaints are carried to an excessive prolixity. That
which might be sufficiently well expressed in five or six
stanzas, sometimes occupies from thirty to forty. Scope
is, however, advantageously given to romantic wit in the
style of the age, by the poetic questions and answers with
which Rodriguez Lobo’s shepherds and shepherdesses occasionally
maintain conversation. In this way antiquated
quaintness is successfully avoided, while the poetic character
of these sportive exercises is carefully preserved.
The plays of wit acquire indeed an augmented interest
by being combined with a kind of poetic competition.
Thus, for example, the question:&mdash;Whether love with or
without hope be the truest love? is answered in two
different songs.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> The question in what degree love and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
jealousy are allied? receives three answers in three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
songs.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> Rodriguez Lobo has not been surpassed by any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
ancient or modern poet in the ingenious simplicity and
elegance of these fanciful compositions. But had he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
been less successful in productions of this class, still
the poetic truth, intensity, delicacy and graceful ease
of his pastoral cantigas and canções would have entitled
him to one of the highest places among the lyric poets
of all nations. The reader readily pardons the tedious
length of the <i>Primavera</i>, as it could not otherwise
include so many lyric poems. Even the antiquated division
into <i>Florestas</i> (flower-beds), will not displease, if
the exquisite lyric effusions which are scattered through
the work, be allowed to represent the flowers. That this
romance is arranged in geographical divisions according
to the rivers of the district in which the scene is
laid, must also be excused, though such a plan may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
not, perhaps, appear quite congenial with the spirit of
romantic poetry.</p>

<p id="His_miscellaneous_poems_245">The other two pastoral romances of Lobo are merely
continuations of his Spring, which according to the plan
on which it is written, might be protracted to infinity.
The first continuation is entitled, <i>O Pastor Peregrino</i>,
(the Wandering Shepherd). It is arranged in divisions,
which, like the acts of the Spanish comedies, bear the
name of <i>jornadas</i>. The second continuation, or the conclusion
of the whole romance, is entitled, <i>O Desenganado</i>,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>
(the Disenchanted), and its divisions are
called <i>discursos</i> (discourses). Here also a rich harvest
of lyric flowers charm the reader, though the romance
itself becomes even less interesting. Rodriguez Lobo
has endeavoured to render this last portion of his
romance in a peculiar way instructive. Towards the
close, as the events become more romantic, he introduces
a portion of his geographical, historical, and
physical knowledge. Still sound judgment and a delicate
spirit of observation are here manifest.</p>

<p>But Rodriguez Lobo who found only within the
boundary or in the vicinity of pastoral poetry the
objects and impressions for the poetic representation of
which he was destined by nature, was induced to
take part with the Portuguese and Spanish poets of
his age in the absurd competition for the prize of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
epopœia. He wrote a work entitled, <i>O Condestabre de
Portugal</i>, (the Generalissimo of Portugal), which he
intended should be a national epic poem. It is, however,
merely a versified biography of the renowned Nuno
Alvarez Pereira, whom the Portuguese of that age
eulogized with an enthusiasm equal to that with which
the Spaniards celebrated their favourite Cid. Rodriguez
Lobo has collected with all requisite patience the most
remarkable events in the life of his hero. He has
arranged them chronologically, dividing the whole into
twenty cantos, and the long narrative is written in neat
octaves. But all the advantage which a story can impart
to a poem is wanting in this tedious work. It is
difficult to conceive how a man of Rodriguez Lobo’s
poetic taste, could have written verses in this style
without being conscious that he was only rhyming historical
prose. The imagination has had but little or
no share either in the cultivation of the style or the
painting of the situations; and the whole work exhibits
no trace of poetic invention. But it is soon evident
that from beginning to end the author is resolved never
to be at variance with historical truth. Thus Rodriguez
Lobo purposely repressed his natural poetic
feeling in order to conform with the false notions of
epic composition, which were at that time firmly established
in Spain and Portugal. So much, indeed, was
he under the dominion of those notions that he has not
had the courage to mingle even as much poetry with his
narrative, as the Spaniard Ercilla introduced in his
Araucana.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> The few stanzas which Camoens in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
Lusiad consecrates to Nuno Alvarez,<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> are worth more
than the twenty cantos of Lobo’s versified biography.
In a philological point of view, however, the composition
deserves praise, for the simplicity, correctness and elegance
of its language. A gleam of poetic beauty here and
there distinguishes some of the descriptive and pathetic
passages, and repays the labour of a perusal.</p>

<p>The predilection which Rodriguez Lobo unconsciously
and almost exclusively entertained for pastoral poetry,
is more than sufficiently proved by the ten eclogues
which are included among the works of this poet, independently
of the three pastoral romances already
noticed. He wished to combine didactic with bucolic
poetry. On this idea he has explained himself in a
preface to his didactic eclogues. Man, he says, has
abandoned the state for which nature destined him,
since he has exchanged the quietude of his rural occupations
and wishes, for a restless and dissatisfied life
by sea and by land. Abel was a shepherd, and all the
succeeding patriarchs, on whom God bestowed his
favour, devoted themselves to the care of flocks and
herds. Amidst rustic occupations the virtues of the
ancient Romans were fostered; and there have arisen in
the pastoral state many great men who have been
called to fill thrones. Country life must therefore be regarded
as the only natural state of existence, and consequently
it is that state to which all the precepts of morality
have reference. Thus poetry cannot be more suitably
combined with morality than through the medium of
pastoral composition. It is therefore nothing surprising
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
that the discourse of shepherds should be the vehicle
of practical philosophy. The shepherd in his smock-frock
has not less correct notions of virtue and vice
than the courtier and man of the world. But poetry
is, generally speaking, merely the clothing of truth.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a>
According to these principles which may be regarded as
a portion of the Portuguese art of poetry in the sixteenth
century, Rodriguez Lobo chose for his didactic
eclogues, a particular moral point of view. The first
is directed against rudeness and ignorance; the second
against hatred and envy; the third against avarice. In
like manner each of the remaining eclogues censures
some particular vice, and the censure is conveyed in a
style of rural gentleness, while the opposite virtue is
recommended by pleasing images. The simple morality
which Rodriguez Lobo puts into the mouths of his
shepherds is certainly not unnatural in their situation.
Far removed also as the critic may be from the
scholastic prejudices which formed the basis of the
poetic art of the sixteenth century, and which would
render poetry a mere robe for morality, still it is
impossible entirely to reject the idea of this species of
didactic eclogue. But such a homely morality, in union
with pastoral poetry, could possess poetic interest, only
at a time when the commonest remarks on moral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
relations, if divested of theological and monastic forms
of expression, had all the charm of novelty. In
the present age, however, when philosophy has long
nourished poetry with more invigorating aliment, the
didactic eclogues of Rodriguez Lobo cannot claim any
particular favour among readers, who justly require that
morality should not directly mix in the business of
poetry, when it has nothing new to tell.</p>

<p>The works of Rodriguez Lobo, also include
about a hundred romances, which, with the exception
of a few, are written in Spanish. The first
half contributed nothing to the advancement of Portuguese
literature. It consists of fifty-six occasional
poems in redondilhas, which are all pompous salutations
of Philip III. who in the year 1619 visited his Portuguese
dominions. Such occasional poems were at the
period denominated romances. But the works of Rodriguez
Lobo conclude with some real romances in the
old spirit and style, which cast a new light on that part
of Portuguese literature. They prove, that which more
ancient data leave doubtful, namely, that the epic or heroic
romance, which in Castile is as old as the Castilian
language, was never completely naturalized in Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>
The narrative romances in particular, the
subjects of which are borrowed from the history of
Moorish knights and ladies, and in which Spanish
poetry is so profusely rich, seem only to have found
their way into Portugal from Spain, and never to have
been perfectly congenial with the national taste of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
Portuguese. <span id="Imitation_of_the_Spanish_romances_250">This kind of romance seems indeed to
be essentially attached to the Castilian language</span>. It
appears that in the age of Rodriguez Lobo, the Spaniards
made it a reproach to the Portuguese that they
wanted the talent necessary for inventing these romances.
Rodriguez Lobo, who was a zealous patriot,
wrote a whole series, but only with the view of ridiculing
this species of composition which appeared to him too
vain-glorious. In an introductory romance he apostrophizes
the <i>romancistas</i> (romance writers) of his
native country. He conjures them, instead of continuing
to plunder the Spanish language, to soar to
distinction by means of originality, since where there
were so many pens, wings could not be wanting. He
begs them to observe, that the laurel tree on Parnassus
had been completely stripped, since to every Spanish
romancist a whole branch had been assigned as a
garland.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> He adds, that they might roam to the
Alhambra and the Alpuxarra in quest of the fair ladies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
Daraja and Celinda, Adalifa and Celidaxa.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> Lobo
follows up this satirical address with a considerable
number of Spanish romances of his own composition,
apparently with the view of proving how easy it is
to write such pieces. Indeed to a poet of Rodriguez
Lobo’s talent it certainly could not be difficult to
produce an exaggerated imitation of the style of the
Spanish national romance. But such extravagant
imitation will not deprive the best of those romances
of the merit which they really possess. Lobo seems
purposely to have introduced among these compositions,
some pastoral romances in the Portuguese language; as
if it were not as easy and even easier to ridicule
pastoral poetry; or as if an exuberance of pastoral
poetry were to be a proof that Portuguese literature
could well dispense with the beautiful epic
romance.</p>

<p>Rodriguez Lobo laid the foundation of that excessive
accumulation of pastoral poetry, existing in the Portuguese
language. He exerted his utmost endeavours to
fix the taste of the nation in that direction. Before he
appeared, the poetic genius of the Portuguese earnestly
and zealously sought distinction in different ways. But
after the period in which Rodriguez Lobo flourished,
the Portuguese poets evinced an exclusive predilection
for the pastoral style, even in other classes of poetic
composition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>


<h3 id="State_of_Portuguese_eloquenc_252">STATE OF PORTUGUESE ELOQUENCE IN THE SIXTEENTH
CENTURY.</h3>

<p>Though Portuguese poetry had now attained a
degree of consideration which in the following century
it was unable to surpass, eloquence, or the elegant
literature of prose remained far behind. That no
writer of talent should have produced a work in Portuguese
prose, which in a rhetorical point of view is
worthy to mark an epoch, may in some respects be
accounted for by peculiar circumstances, and must in
others be attributed merely to the caprice of chance.
The same restrictions on intellectual freedom, which in
Portugal so effectually opposed the full developement
of pure eloquence, had likewise held captive the
thinking faculty in Spain. In Spain, however, a few,
but still some men of talent, who pretended to no
distinction in poetry, learned to move, even in their
fetters, with rhetorical freedom and dignity, and there
was nothing to prevent the occurrence of similar
instances at an equally early period in Portugal. But
it appears, that the Portuguese authors who had no
ambition to be poets, were not endowed with the true
talent for cultivating the art of rhetorical representation,
and that the poets were too much engaged with
their own art, to take any particular interest in the
improvement of any other branch of polite literature.
With the single exception of Rodriguez Lobo, whose
<i>Corte na Aldea</i> afforded in Portugal the first example
how a poet could elevate the language of common life,
without confounding the boundaries of poetry and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
elegant prose, no Portuguese poet of the sixteenth
century in any way contributed to the cultivation of
eloquence; and the period when Rodriguez Lobo
enjoyed his utmost celebrity was not earlier than the
commencement of the seventeenth century. Now
the Portuguese language was then, as the loud
complaint of Lobo sufficiently proves, frequently denied,
even in Portugal, any claim to the possession of
that accuracy and elegance, without which poetry,
deficient merely in cultivation, might indeed exist, but
which is indispensably necessary to prose composition,
when it is to be elevated above the formal style of ceremony,
and the negligent expression of common life.
Thus it seems to have happened that some Portuguese
historians and moralists, who, even in the first half of
the sixteenth century, had actually formed their style to
a certain extent on the ancient models, still unconsciously
fell into the rude manner of the chronicle and monastic
prose. In Spain elegant prose was afforded the opportunity
of an earlier developement, for the national pride
of the Castilians had at all times powerfully protected
the Castilian language; and men of learning who entertained
a different opinion had not the deciding voice.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></p>


<h3 id="Romances_and_novels_253">ROMANCES AND NOVELS.</h3>

<p>The novel style was at this period not more
prejudicial to true eloquence in Portugal than in Spain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
Every reader, however, unconscious of any theoretical
reasoning on such subjects, regarded the romances and
novels which were now profusely circulated as scions
from the old stock of the national poetry. They were
judged according to poetic laws; while fictitious events
in forms wholly prosaic, would have been justly declared
counterfeit. But the Portuguese attributed to themselves
the peculiar merit of ingenious invention, and of
an excellent, if not a perfect, style in the relation of
romantic events. <i>Palmerin de Oliva</i>, which next to
Amadis de Gaul, Cervantes spares in his judgment on
romances of chivalry, was written by Francisco de
Moràes, a Portuguese courtier and man of the world;
and it has already been mentioned, that even Amadis,
in its original form, is considered to have been the
production of a Portuguese.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> Francisco de Moràes
lived in the reign of John III. and he visited the
French court in the suite of the Portuguese ambassador.
This visit may have contributed to nurture his taste for
romances of chivalry, which were then greatly in favour
with people of rank in France.</p>


<h3 id="Sa_Sotomayor_254">SA SOTOMAYOR.</h3>

<p>Many other Portuguese romances of different kinds
were produced in the sixteenth century. The prize
awarded to Rodriguez Lobo, as author of the most
celebrated pastoral romance, had already been an object
of ambition with Eloy de Sà Sotomayor, whose <i>Ribeiras
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
do Mondego</i>, (Banks of the Mondego),<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> was not, however,
so early known as Lobo’s work. From the preface
to the <i>Ribeiras</i>, it is quite evident that Rodriguez
Lobo had, according to the fashion of the age, introduced
into his pastoral romances a disguised picture
of affairs of love which personally interested himself.
Sà Sotomayor, who was also a bachelor of canon
law, was considered one of the most successful rivals
of Rodriguez Lobo, in romantic composition. But as
a poet, he was in every respect far inferior. His
narrative and descriptive styles are not destitute of
grace.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> His verses, however, cannot bear comparison
with those of Lobo: and even his most natural pictures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
of sentiment are deficient in novelty of idea and ingenious
simplicity.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>


<h3 id="Pires_de_Rebello_256">PIRES DE REBELLO.</h3>

<p>Among the Portuguese chivalric romances, which
were so assiduously read in the sixteenth century, may
be numbered <i>A Constante Florinda</i>, (the Constant
Florinda) of Gaspar Pires de Rebello, who was likewise
the author of some short didactic novels, (<i>novelas
exemplares</i>) which were published about the period at
which Cervantes enriched Spanish literature with tales
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
of a totally different standard, though bearing the same
title.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> Rebello entertained a very high opinion of the
usefulness of his novels;<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> but his inventions are common
place; and his unceasing display of mythological
learning is as affected as are many of his similies and
images.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>


<h3 id="Progress_of_the_historical_art_258">PROGRESS OF THE HISTORICAL ART.</h3>

<p>But the historical works which were written in the
Portuguese language in the sixteenth century, are more
important to the lover of literature, as well as the
politician, than the other compositions in prose which
have just been noticed. In Portugal, as well as in
Spain, relations of real events had long been completely
distinguished from romantic prose. But before
the old chronicle style could become entirely
obsolete, it was necessary that the old chronicle spirit
should yield to the nobler spirit of historic art; and
to this in that age, with all its great events, there
was little inducement in Portugal. The ancient classic
historians were, it is true, read and studied; but when
Portuguese writers attempted to imitate them, they at
most only succeeded in producing some resemblance to
their force of description, and in a certain degree to
their elegance of expression, but failed altogether in the
arrangement of events according to the just idea of historical
utility, and in the delicacy of the shades of an
historical picture. Indeed the rude spirit of the chronicles
seemed then to belong no less essentially to the
narration of modern events, than the rhyme and the
metres of romantic verse to modern poetry. He who
felt himself called to be the historian of his native
country, necessarily endeavoured to render himself
no less intimate with the old chronicles than with
classic authors; and, if, fully imbued with his subject, he
took up the thread of the narrative where an earlier
chronicler had dropped it, he unconsciously fell into the
style of that chronicler. Had fate transplanted for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
several years to Italy, and placed in a sphere of political
and literary activity, a Portuguese possessing the talent
and energy of Diego de Mendoza, he would probably,
like that distinguished Spaniard, have there learned to
compose an historical work according to justly conceived
ideas of historical art, independently of the influence of
the chronicles.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> But in India, to which at that time all
Portuguese subjects who wished to rise in the service of
their country eagerly hastened, it was not to be expected
that a historian could be formed. Still, however,
the historical literature of the Portuguese of the sixteenth
century, when considered with reference to its
rhetorical character, possesses a degree of interest which
the elegant compilations of later historians cannot excite.
The men who at that memorable epoch, either
from their own inclination, or as Cronistas in the
service of the government, related the history of their
native country, and more particularly of the Portuguese
discoveries and conquests, were inspired with
ardent national feeling, and that feeling they communicated
to their works. Their narratives have character.
The manner in which that character displays
itself, is doubtless too prominent in cases in which
the national interests come into conflict with claims of
foreign powers. But an endeavour to preserve historical
fidelity, is in general observable in the works of
these writers. To confound them with the common
chroniclers would be doing them great injustice. They
earnestly endeavoured to introduce into their narratives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
as much of the style of the ancient classics as could be
united with the style of the chronicle; and the remote
traces of that historical art in which they were deficient
are to be recognized in their works. It was not so
much their object to string facts together, as to combine
remarkable events as far as they were able, under one
practical point of view.</p>


<h3 id="Joao_de_Barros_260">JOAÕ DE BARROS.</h3>

<p>The events of India formed the favourite theme
of many of the Portuguese Cronistas of the sixteenth
century. At the head of these industrious
writers stands Joaõ de Barros, whose name is not altogether
unknown in literature, beyond the boundaries
of his native land. In the early part of the sixteenth
century he was distinguished by his talents
and acquirements among the young men of rank, who
were educated at the court of Emanuel the Great.
At this period he seems to have applied himself with
particular delight to the study of the Roman historians,
and in particular of Livy. In his twenty-first
year he produced a romance of chivalry. King Emanuel,
who on reading this romance thought that he
perceived in the youthful author a talent for historical
composition, commissioned him to draw up an account
of the oriental discoveries and conquests of the Portuguese.
Barros immediately prepared for the commencement
of his arduous task; the execution of which
was, however, delayed for some time in consequence of
the death of King Emanuel. But he was speedily solicited
by King John III. not to relinquish his design,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
and, as an encouragement, was invested with the lucrative
but troublesome post of Treasurer to the Indian
department (<i>Caza da India</i>). Without neglecting the
duties of this office, Barros indefatigably collected materials
for his great historical work, which he commenced
and continued with unremitting activity until
a short time previous to his decease. He died in the
year 1570, at the age of seventy-four. The Portuguese
have surnamed him their Livy. His historical labours
sufficiently prove that he did not study Livy in vain,
and though he cannot justly claim a place near that
historian, yet are his labours well deserving of an ample
notice in the history of Portuguese literature.</p>

<p>The celebrated work of Joaõ de Barros is entitled
“Asia, or the Atchievements which the Portuguese
performed in the Discovery and Conquest of the Seas
and Lands of the Orient.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a>” The books are, like those
of Livy’s works, distributed into decades. These decades
are four in number, and each makes a moderately sized
folio volume. In this work Barros, though he embraces
only the most brilliant portion of Portuguese history, has
pursued an idea similar to that which governed Livy, for
he constantly endeavours to illustrate and render self-evident
the greatness of the Portuguese name, as Livy
does the majesty of the Roman people. Whether
national pride may not sometimes have seduced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
him into violations of historical truth, is a question
which the historian of eloquence cannot be required to
investigate.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> This Portuguese Livy has to a certain
degree approached the excellence of his model in the
art of historical description. His language is sometimes
not merely elegant; but the pictures he draws
exhibit an unaffected charm of intuitive representation.
These descriptions are neither disfigured by pompous
phrases nor poetic excrescences; and they still possess
a lively internal spirit as well when rural or urbane
scenery is depicted,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> as when military events are represented.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
But passages thus distinguished for rhetorical
beauty are only occasionally to be found in the works
of Barros. His narrative style is, upon the whole,
merely the old chronicle style, with the diction somewhat
more elevated; and even his diction abounds in
expressions which were beginning to grow antiquated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
at the period when he wrote. The practice of commencing
several sentences in succession by the conjunction
<i>and</i>, in the manner of the old chronicles, is not
uncommon in the writings of Barros. But he seldom
attains the real flexibility of the long, yet harmoniously
articulated sentences of Livy. Barros sometimes very
happily inculcates his practical views by speeches in the
manner of the ancients, which under certain circumstances
he introduces as delivered by the Public, in order
to express in the most natural way all that can be said
for and against certain enterprises; such, for example,
as the continual fitting out, under the auspices of Prince
Henry, so celebrated in the history of discoveries of
vessels, for the further exploring of the new passage to
India.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> Speeches by individuals, though seldom, are for
the most part not inappropriately introduced; but the
insipid style of the chronicles is then very unseasonably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
retained.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> Least of all did Barros understand the
drawing of character; and in this respect the difference
between the Roman and the Portuguese Livy is most
striking. The monkish point of view in which this
author, like every other of his age in Portugal and
Spain, regarded the faults and excellencies of human
character, rendered any thing like natural portraiture
impossible. An ancient Roman observer of human nature
would not, for instance, have deduced the courtesy
and gentleness of Prince Henry, the encourager of navigation,
from the purity of that prince’s soul, with an
intimation that such a conclusion was to be drawn
because he was held to be truly virginal.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> In the spirit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
of his age, Barros seizes every opportunity for putting
forward his catholic opinions, though the result is by
no means to the advantage of his historical work.</p>


<h3 id="Lopez_de_Castanheda_266">LOPEZ DE CASTANHEDA&mdash;DAMIAÕ DE GÓES&mdash;AFFONSO
D’ALBOQUERQUE.</h3>

<p>In order to form a correct estimate of the rhetorical
merit of Barros, with reference to the age in
which he lived, it is necessary to compare his historical
works with others which were written in Portugal at
the same period and on the same subjects. In this
comparison Barros will be found to shine forth as a
light of superior lustre. With equal patriotism and
industry, and with a greater sacrifice of his own interest,
Fernaõ Lopez de Castanheda composed his history
of the discovery and conquest of India by the
Portuguese: a narrative of events, which, though compendious
in form, exhibits the most laborious accuracy
in the investigation of facts.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> But whatever may be
the historical merit of this work, it is, as to rhetorical
character, merely a common chronicle. The diffuse
chronicle of King Emanuel, which was about this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
period edited by Damiaõ de Góes, is also interesting
only to the historian.</p>

<p>The life of the great Affonso d’Alboquerque,
composed by his son, Affonso d’Alboquerque, the
younger, is a biographical chronicle, which may be
placed on a parallel with the works entitled, Histories,
which have just been noticed.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> No historical work
enjoys greater esteem in Portuguese literature: and
that a father so celebrated, should have found so worthy
a narrator of his atchievements in his son, certainly
was not a thing easily to be anticipated. But in the
scale of rhetorical merit, these Commentaries, as the
work is usually denominated, weigh but lightly. The
language may be said to be pure, but the style is
monotonous; and upon the whole it is merely a repetition
of the old chronicle style.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>


<h3 id="Bernardo_de_Brito_268">BERNARDO DE BRITO.</h3>

<p>Bernardo de Brito, a Portuguese historian, who
lived in the latter end of the sixteenth and beginning
of the seventeenth centuries, possessed a far higher
degree of historical cultivation. He was educated at
Rome, and was master of several modern languages.
He devoted himself to the ecclesiastical profession, but
in the cloister he followed his predilection for Portuguese
history; and as authorized Cronista of his convent,
he undertook the arduous task of writing a complete
history of the Portuguese monarchy. He died in
the year 1617, in the forty-seventh year of his age,
without having attained the object to which he honourably
aspired. But, notwithstanding his early death, he
might have succeeded in completing the history of his
native country, had not the plan on which he proceeded
placed that object beyond his reach. The idea of a
history of the Portuguese monarchy, would have been
properly fulfilled by commencing with the foundation
of that monarchy, and in an introduction only, referring
back somewhat beyond the eleventh century. But
Bernardo de Brito contemplated the execution of a
work of much greater magnitude. His <i>Monarchia
Lusitana</i> was intended to be a complete history of the
country, now called Portugal, from the most remote
antiquity down to the latest period.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> The ancient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
history of Portugal was with him a favourite part of
his subject. It is probable that he wished his history
to rank as a companion to the Spanish work of Florian
de Ocampo, who in the reign of Charles V. commenced
on a similar plan, a history of the Spanish monarchy
from the time of the flood.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> Brito, however, did not
think that period sufficiently remote, but chose to start
from the creation of the world. Whatever particulars
are furnished by ancient authors, concerning Lusitania
and the Lusitanians of the earliest ages, he has collected,
examined, and arranged in historical connection.
But a thick folio volume, which includes the
four first books, brings the history no further than the
birth of Christ; and towards the end of the second
volume, where the history of modern Portugal commences,
the work breaks off. Had it been completed,
still it would not have been an easy matter to have
brought the numerous notices respecting Portuguese
antiquities, which Brito has introduced, under a point
of view whereby they might have formed an appropriate
union with the heterogeneous events of modern history.
But the work is eminently distinguished for style and
descriptive talent. The ingenious author seems like
many other eminent persons of his age to have derived
particular advantage from his residence in Italy.
Without deteriorating by laborious polish, the vigorous
style which is indispensable to historical composition,
he gives even dry narratives of facts in a manner totally
different from the compilers of the old chronicles;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
and where the internal interest of the subject animates
the description, Brito’s historical pictures possess an
impressive effect, which marks the pupil of the ancient
classic writers.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<p>Brito’s preface, in which he gives an account of
the spirit and plan of his history of the Portuguese
monarchy, merits attention. He observes that even his
own countrymen advised him to write his work, if not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
in Latin or Italian, at least in Spanish, in order to
afford it an opportunity of being read beyond the confines
of Portugal, and also for the sake of avoiding the
vulgarity into which his native tongue might betray
him.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> Thus, even in Portugal, during the sixteenth
century, notwithstanding the progress made by Portuguese
literature, the detractors of the Portuguese
language must have been exceedingly numerous, since
their conduct is so frequently a subject of complaint
with patriotic writers. Brito was one of the patriots
who most loudly expressed his indignation against that
anti-national party. The Portuguese language, he says,
has fallen into disrepute only because Portugal cherishes
“ungrateful sons, like poisonous vipers.”<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> He expresses
his regret, that though possessing a little better knowledge
of his native language, he could not write in the
most brilliant style, which is only to be done when the
author bestows greater attention on elegance of expression
than on the veracity of facts, which is unworthy
of a true historian.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></p>

<p>A smaller historical work by Bernardo de Brito,
from its title of <i>Elogios dos reys de Portugal</i>, (Eulogies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
on the Kings of Portugal) seems to promise to the
historian of eloquence a kind of rhetorical memoires,
from which not a little might be expected. But these
eulogies are brief and dull notices, and scarcely afford
groundwork for biographical sketches. They are merely
intended to illustrate the copper-plate portraits of the
kings of Portugal, which are included in the work.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>The travels of Fernaõ Mendez Pinto,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> may also
be numbered among the works written in cultivated
Portuguese prose, which appeared during the sixteenth
century. It seems to have been the first book of
travels, the author of which bestowed labour on narrative
and descriptive style.</p>

<p>The cultivation of the other departments of prosaic
composition appears to have been at this period very
much neglected in Portugal. Some moral treatises,
written by the historian Barros, in the dialogue form,
perhaps merit to be again brought into notice.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> A <i>Panegyrico</i>
by the same author on an Infanta Maria, has
also the reputation of being eloquently written.</p>

<p>An art of poetry and rhetoric composed on practical
principles, and calculated to convey useful instruction,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
was not to be expected while writers had still
sufficient difficulty in the preliminary study of the
grammatical rules and purity of diction. To facilitate
the acquisition of both, Nunez de Liaõ wrote his book
on the origin of the Portuguese language, and his introduction
to Portuguese orthography.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

FROM THE LATTER YEARS OF THE SIXTEENTH
CENTURY UNTIL TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE
SEVENTEENTH.</span></h2>


<h3 id="Decay_of_the_ancient_273"><i>Decay of the ancient national energy in Portuguese Literature.</i></h3>

<p>At the end of the sixteenth century the most
brilliant period of Portuguese poetry had passed away.
A new epoch did not, it is true, commence; for the style
of invention and composition which during that century
was introduced, continued essentially unaltered. The influence
which the fantastic school of the Gongorists
produced, in the first half of the seventeenth century,
on most of the Portuguese writers, did not entirely
repress the cultivation of the better style.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> But the
proper place to form a resting point in the account of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
the second period of the polite literature of Portugal is
the present, for here genius ceased to advance, and
dextrous talent merely traded on the stock which the
sixteenth century had bequeathed. According to the
plan of a history, in which it is intended to describe circumstantially,
only the progress of poetic and rhetorical
genius and taste, the account of Portuguese poetry and
eloquence in the seventeenth century must therefore form
merely a summary appendix to the preceding chapters.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the present book it was
remarked, that the loss of independence experienced by
the kingdom of Portugal, was attended with no immediate
injury to Portuguese literature. The Spanish
language could obtain no higher consideration in Portugal
than it already enjoyed. The humbled national
pride took pleasure in the courageous defence of the
national language, and the Castilian tongue only served
to remind the patriotic Portuguese of the ignominious
occupation of his country. But several circumstances
concurred to limit poetic genius in Portugal to a somewhat
monotonous continuation of the old style in a few
branches of poetic composition, while in Spain dramatic
poetry, full of national boldness, rapidly advanced in the
career of well merited fame. That fate had denied a
Lope de Vega to the Portuguese language is not sufficient
to account for this contrast, the Spanish would still
have been banished from the stage in Portugal, had a
Portuguese national theatre vied with that of Spain.
In that case the competition of numerous poets would,
perhaps, have ensured the cultivation of dramatic composition
in the language of the country, which, since the
death of Gil Vicente, had been neglected. But even Gil
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
Vicente, as has been already observed, wrote his first
drama in Spanish; and in his subsequent works he interspersed
the Spanish with the Portuguese language, as
if he felt that the latter was not of itself fitted to supply
dialogue throughout the whole of a dramatic performance.
The genuine Portuguese comedies of Saa de Miranda and
Antonio Ferreira were by no means sufficiently national to
excite the imitation of a poet who might wish to produce
an effect upon the great body of the Portuguese public.
Meanwhile the comedies of Lope de Vega found their
way into Portugal, and since that period this class of
comedy seemed to require the Spanish language to
render it perfect. In the seventeenth century, many
Spanish comedies were written by Portuguese authors;
and the Portuguese poets who adhered to their mother
tongue, sought another sphere. During the sixty years
in which there was no court in Lisbon, Portuguese
poetry withdrew entirely within the circle of private
relations. The lyric forms of romantic love, with a
supplemental supply of the favourite amatory pastoral
poetry, and of versified jests of various kinds, seemed fully
to satisfy the public. That the spirit of vigorous emulation
should so suddenly have vanished among the Portuguese
poets, would, however, be inconceivable, were it not
that in Spain about the same period, every species of
poetic composition, except dramatic poetry, which flowed
like an impetuous torrent, remained stationary at the
point at which it stood in the beginning of the seventeenth
century. Both the Spaniards and the Portuguese
felt the paralyzing influence of the political relations of
their deeply humiliated countries; and in both nations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
despotism, spiritual and temporal, finally overthrew the
power which had long kept it in equipoise. Even in
Portugal, therefore, the restoration of the independence
of the kingdom in the year 1640, though it excited
new ebullitions of patriotism, could produce no new
freedoms in poetry.</p>


<h3 id="Portuguese_sonnets_276">PORTUGUESE SONNETS IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

<p>In the history of Portuguese poetry, the seventeenth
century may be called <i>the Age of Sonnets</i>. Lyric art
in the old national syllabic metres was entirely abandoned
in serious poetry. The composition of sonnets
formed the particular recommendation of the man of
the world in the circle of polite society; and both in
spiritual and temporal affairs, sonnets were resorted to
as the means of extricating their authors from difficulty.
It would almost appear that at this period poetic merit
in Portugal was estimated solely by the inexhaustible
facility which an author displayed in the composition of
these trifles. To acquire the title of a poet certainly
nothing more was necessary than to write a few sonnets
not absolutely contemptible. Thus, in the year 1631,
when the number of printed Portuguese sonnets was
increasing by thousands, Jacinto Cordeiro,<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> a minute
calculator of the poetic fame of his nation, added a
supplement of thirty-eight names of Portuguese bards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
to the list of Spanish and Portuguese poets, which
Lope de Vega had furnished in his celebrated <i>Laurel
de Apolo</i>.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> Doubtless this erroneous estimate of the
poetic glory of the nation contributed to check the
growth of talent which might have taken a loftier
flight, had not a few neatly turned sonnets been sufficient
in public opinion, to confer on any individual all
the fame of a poet. The limits of a general history
of modern poetry are too narrow to afford room
for a detailed notice of these sonneteers; a particular
account can, therefore, only be given of a few of the
most celebrated among them, who were also the authors
of other poetical works, or who in any way assisted in
improving or deteriorating the literary taste of their
country.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>


<h3 id="Faria_e_Sousa_277">FARIA E SOUSA.</h3>

<p>Manoel de Faria e Sousa who has been so repeatedly
mentioned in the course of the present volume, and who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
has not been passed by unnoticed in the history of
Spanish poetry,<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> exercised an important influence on
the poetry of the Portuguese sonneteers, particularly in
the first half of the seventeenth century. Possessing
uncommon faculties, which were early disclosed, and
early perverted, he distinguished himself while yet a
youth by his extraordinary talents and powers of memory.
In the year 1605, he participated, in quality of
secretary, in the official duties of one of his relations,
under whom he received the education fitting for a
statesman. But neither his talents and acquirements,
nor his connection with the most distinguished families
of his native country, having conducted him to an object
commensurate with his diligence and ambition, he quitted
Portugal and visited Madrid. Though he did not
realize all his expectations in the Spanish capital, he
was not entirely neglected. He obtained a post in an
embassy to Rome; and on his return to Madrid he
found at least a tolerable source of subsistence. Still,
however, he continued dissatisfied with his income, and
on that account his pen was in constant activity. He
himself states that he daily wrote twelve sheets, each
page containing thirty lines. He possessed so great a
facility in rhetorical turns and flourishes, that in the
space of a single day he could compose a hundred
addresses of congratulation and condolence, all sufficiently
different from each other. As an author both
in verse and in prose, he continued to labour with unabated
assiduity to the period of his death, which happened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
in the year 1649.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> A considerable portion of his
numerous works will preserve his name in honourable
recollection; but the value of that portion greatly depends
on the subjects it embraces. They belong to the
department of history and statistics, but they are all
written in Spanish, and therefore cannot with propriety
be farther noticed in the history of Portuguese literature.
Faria e Sousa’s poems are also chiefly in Spanish; <span id="His_sonnets_279">he
wrote only sonnets and eclogues in Portuguese verse</span>z.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a>
Of the six hundred, or to use his own phrase,
“the six centuries” of sonnets, which, as it appears
he selected for posterity out of a still greater number,
precisely two hundred are Portuguese. Some of these
compositions merit the praise which Faria e Sousa’s
admirers have lavished on them all;<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> and the whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
collection is animated by a buoyant spirit, which soars
above ordinary and moderate elegance. But this spirit
could not long accommodate itself to sound poetic judgment,
nor to the old simplicity and natural flow of
ideas and images. Without intentionally becoming an
imitator of the Italian Marinists, the Spanish Gongorists,
or the school of Lope de Vega, Faria e Sousa
revelled in bold flights of fancy, like Lope de Vega,
and indulged in eccentric extravagancies like the Marinists
and Gongorists. The poetic flowers in his sonnets
are overgrown by luxuriant parasitical weeds. In
the first Century of the sonnets in the Portuguese
language love is the only theme. The introductory
sonnet announces that they are intended to celebrate
the “penetrating shafts of love, which were shot from
a pair of heavenly eyes, and which after inflicting immortal
wounds, issued triumphant from the poet’s
breast.”<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> This style pervades the whole collection.
In one place a tender swain, named Menalio, forbids
the satyres of the wood to steep their feet in the brook
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
which has served as a bath to the fair Albania, that
“morning-star, who in the depth of the water is the
first of suns, where the sun himself is dazzled.”<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> On
another occasion the poet complains of the “bitter
taste he experiences in his mouth,” when he describes
his pain to his mistress.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Sometimes it is scarcely possible
to guess the meaning of these romantic conceits.
But this style of poetic composition was by the admirers
of Faria e Sousa denominated the ingenious and
the tender style. The principal sonnets in the second
Century pursue the same theme of romantic love, but
they are sometimes so charming that the beauty of the
successful passages, nearly throws into shade the distortions
by which even that beauty is more or less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
alloyed.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> Among the moral sonnets in this Century
there are several which, though not abounding in ingenious
ideas, are nevertheless expressive pictures of
sentiment.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> The <i>sonetos sacros</i> (spiritual sonnets), with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
which the collection closes, are, however, destitute of
all trace of poetic merit. Whatever deserves to be
pointed out as remarkable in the twelve Portuguese
eclogues of Faria e Sousa, may with propriety be
included in the notice respecting the degree of merit
which this industrious writer possessed as a poetic
theorist.</p>

<p id="His_treatises_on_poetry_283">Faria e Sousa is the author of three treatises; the
first, “On the sonnet;” the second, “On the erroneous
notions of the moderns concerning poetry;” and the
third, “On pastoral poetry.” These works must not be
overlooked in the history of the literary taste of Portugal,
since theoretical prolusions of this kind by poetic
writers, supplied the place of a detailed art of poetry
in Portuguese literature. All these treatises are written
in the Spanish language.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> The first, which is entitled
<i>Discurso de los Sonetos</i>, is in itself insignificant. It
merely contains a few scanty notices on the history of
sonnet poetry, and some trifling observations hastily
thrown together on the appropriateness of the sonnet
metre in Spanish and Portuguese poetry. But towards
the close of the treatise Faria e Sousa advances a very
wide principle, which is exceedingly convenient for him
in its application to his peculiar style of composition. One
certainly must not, he says, grant absolution for excrescences
and licences in poetry, from the notion that elegant
language is of less importance than bold and
beautiful ideas; but it is not to be forgotten “that a
great man may sometimes do what he pleases, and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
it is a great crime to call him to account for so doing,
more particularly when those by whom he is called to
account are pigmies in knowledge and judgment.”<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a>
That Faria e Sousa ranked himself in the class of
great men is a circumstance which admits of no doubt.
In his second treatise (<i>Contra la opinion moderna
acerca lo que es poesia</i>) he has more clearly explained
the nature of the ideas which in his opinion are more
to be esteemed in poetry than elegant words. In the
first place he applies the just principle that language
does not make a poet in so loose and perverted a
manner as to imply that correct versification is but of
little importance. He then reasons again on a just
principle most inconsistently, concerning the essence of
poetry. He first observes that the essence of poetry as
little consists in fine phrases and even in grand ideas,
as in deep knowledge or in polished verse, (<i>versos
muy peinados</i>). He next makes this assertion,&mdash;“the
only things required in poetry are invention, imagery,
pathos, and a display of every kind of knowledge.”<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a>
Considered in this point of view, he admits
Marino to be far inferior to Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Dante,
Ariosto, and similar poets. But then Torquato Tasso is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
scarcely a poet worth naming; for in Tasso’s poetry
there is but little learning, little invention, and a common
style of composition. Tasso is in his opinion a
second Lucan, and nothing more; a historian indeed,
but no poet. Finally, he complains that allegory, which
he regards as particularly necessary to the beauty of a
great poem, is totally wanting in Tasso’s Jerusalem
Delivered. Faria e Sousa seems to have picked up in
Italy the opinions which form the groundwork of his
vituperation of Tasso and his Jerusalem. Having
ceased to rail against Tasso, he proceeds to declaim
concerning poetry in a series of paragraphs, which
plainly shew that he was totally deficient in clearness
of ideas on the subject. Six of these paragraphs, in
immediate succession, commence with such phrases as
the following:&mdash;“He understands nothing of the matter;”
or more briefly, “he is a fool,” (<i>es necio</i>); or “he
is an absolute fool (<i>es totalmente necio</i>) who supposes,”
&amp;c. or “it is a proof of perfect ignorance,” (<i>purissima
ignorancia</i>); or “it is a proof of a total want of
knowledge of poetry to assert,” &amp;c. And yet after all
these rude sallies against a party which perhaps did no
more than earnestly resist his attacks on correctness of
ideas and language, he comes at last merely to this conclusion,
that a writer of great genius must not be
restrained by trifles, and that in his poetry he need only
avoid singularity, coarseness and unintelligibility.</p>

<p>In a general history of literature any particular
notice of these half true, but mainly trivial declamations,
would be quite unnecessary, had not this author
been for a considerable period revered as a critical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
oracle in Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> The absurd conversion of the
pastoral style into a mere poetic figure was among
other faults of Portuguese poetry, methodically favoured
and confirmed by the fallacious theories of Faria e Sousa.
The earlier Portuguese poets who availed themselves of
this inappropriate freedom merely followed a custom which
had accidentally arisen. After transforming all sorts of
occasional poems into <span id="His_eclogues_286">eclogues</span>, they at least endeavoured
to give these factitious eclogues a pastoral character.
But Faria e Sousa having formed a perverted judgment
on pastoral poetry, proceeded in conformity with that
judgment to exhibit various kinds of completely disfigured
eclogues. In his treatise on his own pastoral
poems, he theoretically praises himself for never having
attempted any species of poetic composition on which he
did not confer some novelty. He was accordingly less
scrupulous than the eclogue writers who had preceded
him, in introducing into such poems characters from the
great and polite world. It seems with him to be sufficient
that the scene shall always be in the country.
He composed, however, a few eclogues in the true spirit
and style of pastoral life. He likewise endeavoured to
introduce into pastoral poetry more of action and interesting
incident than is usually exhibited in that species
of composition, so that in this respect some of his eclogues
are brought into comparison with serious comedies. According
to these and similar principles, Faria e Sousa
distinguished his love eclogues (<i>eglogas amorosas</i>,) from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
hunting eclogues (<i>venatorias</i>), sea-faring eclogues (<i>maritimas</i>),
properly pastoral or rather rustic eclogues
(<i>rusticas</i>), funeral eclogues (<i>funebres</i>), and other modifications
of similar description. In pursuance of
his theory he recognized even arbitrator eclogues (<i>arbitrarias</i>),
monastic eclogues (<i>monasticos</i>), critical
eclogues (<i>criticas</i>), genealogical eclogues (<i>genealogicas</i>),
hermit eclogues (<i>eremiticas</i>), and finally, as a particular
species, fantastical eclogues (<i>fantasticas</i>), the theme of
which is a prophetic vision. Of all these styles he has
given specimens according to his own fancy. The same
confusion of ideas on which his art of poetry is founded,
and the same search after the uncommon at the expense
of sound judgment, pervades the whole of this collection
of eclogues. The beautiful idea which pastoral poetry
presents was completely lost in the way in which Faria
e Sousa viewed it. He attached but little importance
to the representation of a poetic rural life, and still less
to ideal simplicity, his wish being to sport, after his
own manner, in bucolic forms, with crude conceits,
affected pathos, and extravagant images. His rustic
eclogues are, it is true, sufficiently rural, but not in the
style of Saa de Miranda, who with the most delicate
art gave a poetic dignity to rustic manners. Faria e
Sousa’s shepherds are absolute clowns; and he accordingly
makes them discourse in a kind of low Portuguese,
one half of which is unintelligible to foreigners
unacquainted with the rudest dialect of the peasantry
of Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p id="His_commentary_288">Faria e Sousa crowned his efforts towards the literary
cultivation of his age by a diffuse commentary
on the works of Camoens,&mdash;a production more calculated
to obscure than to illustrate the original. This
commentary is written in Spanish.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> The value of the
historical portion would be greatly enhanced, were it
separated from the critical, so that the latter might be
rejected and only the former retained. But the historical
data which Faria e Sousa has collected for the
elucidation of Camoens’s poems, and particularly the
Lusiad, are everywhere interwoven with the critical
paraphrase of the text, and that paraphrase is so overloaded
with a mass of erudition not merely superfluous,
but totally unconnected with the subject, that in the
present age, a reader of the works of Camoens, might
be enabled to estimate the extent of his admiration of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
the poet by the degree of patience with which he peruses
the labours of this commentator. Faria e Sousa has
furnished a new example of the little profit to be
derived from critical investigation, by a man who does
not commence with a mind rightly cultivated for such a
study. His admiration of Camoens contributes nothing
to the improvement of his own poetic talent, for he
always forces his own perverted views into Camoens’s
poetry.</p>

<p>The esteem which Faria e Sousa obtained in Portuguese
literature, must have contributed not a little to
promote the endless rhyming of sonnets, and to impede
the developement of the loftier style of poetry in
Portugal. The false liberality of his critical code
proved very convenient for the sonneteers, who experienced
but little difficulty in exhibiting the qualities
which that critic required in their compositions; and
the unreasonable severity with which he treated Tasso
was calculated to seduce every eccentric sonneteer into
the conceit that he was himself something more than a
Tasso. The pretensions of Faria e Sousa were not,
however, universally recognized on the Portuguese Parnassus.
Even in the composition of sonnets, some of
the principal Portuguese poets of the seventeenth
century followed the more pure and elevated style of
Camoens. But no one thought of avoiding the faults
into which Camoens had fallen. That prince of Portuguese
poets was always regarded as faultless.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span></p>


<h3 id="Thomas_de_Noronha_290">THOMAS DE NORONHA.</h3>

<p>Comic sonnet poetry, in which Camoens did not
distinguish himself as a master, obtained a favourable
reception from the Portuguese public on Thomas de
Noronha, a contemporary of Faria e Sousa becoming
celebrated for that kind of composition.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> But Thomas
de Noronha, though an agreeable man of the world, was
but a pretender in wit. His writings probably acquired a
particular interest from the convivial temper, for which
he was distinguished in society, and of which the reader
is reminded by his poetry. But such versified jests as
this merry companion has left behind him, could only
have obtained temporary popularity from personal and
local circumstances. They want the sprightly extravagance
of the burlesque poetry of the Italians, as well
as the moral keeping and caustic delicacy of the more
lofty style of satire. Burlesque, however, they certainly
are. Some approach, at least in a coarse way, to the
Italian jests of a similar kind;<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> and in others jesting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
and serious feeling are blended together in a very absurd
manner. Thomas de Noronha thought fit to write a
burlesque sonnet in honour of Rodriguez Lobo, when
that poet was drowned in the Tagus. After a comic
apostrophe to heaven and earth, Noronha declares that if
he can catch Æolus he will give him a flogging.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> In
nearly the same manner he jests in comic canções and
romances, and in redondilha stanzas, (<i>decimas</i>,) which
may also be termed epigrams. In these verses the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
conceits frequently turn on a play of words. Many
must be altogether unintelligible to the foreign reader,
particularly in the nineteenth century.</p>


<h3 id="Barbosa_Bacellar_292">BARBOSA BACELLAR.</h3>

<p>As a writer of serious sonnets, and particularly of
romantic love sonnets in the style of Camoens, no
Portuguese poet of the seventeenth century was more
successful than the elegant and ingenious Antonio
Barbosa Bacellar, who was also celebrated as one of
the most skilful disputants of the university of Coimbra.
After filling various public offices, he died in the year
1663.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> Barbosa Bacellar’s inclination to form his taste
on the model of Camoens, is proved by several excellent
glosses, which he composed on some of that great poet’s
sonnets. He may indeed be ranked among the most
distinguished writers of poetic glosses. In all his
poems, many of which are written in the Spanish
language, he has disdained those excrescences which
Faria e Sousa commends as a proof of unconstrained
genius. Barbosa Bacellar was one of the supporters
of the correct style of sonnet composition, in whom the
spirit of the sixteenth century survived; but so little
was he disposed to approve the jejune correctness of
Ferreira and Caminha, that he preferred deviating into
the opposite extreme, rather than repress the spirit of
his poetry by a rigid adherence to forms. He excelled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
in the art of ingeniously amplifying a romantic idea
without allowing the sentimental to degenerate into the
fantastic. Besides some very charming sonnets,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> the
most remarkable productions of this poet are the
extended pictures of romantic aspiration which since
his time have been distinguished in Portuguese poetry
by the untranslatable name of <i>Saudades</i>.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> The complaints
of a lovelorn heart vented in solitude, are the
only materials which enter into the composition of these
poems; and the peculiar character of their class, which
had rapidly grown into favour, was fixed by Barbosa Bacellar.
A certain degree of prolixity is essential to these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
compositions. They do not well afford opportunity for
the display of a brilliant store of novel ideas; and to
employ an inexhaustible flow of words in painting the
tender longing of love was deemed a proof of the
ardour of the passion. They might very properly be
classed with elegies, were it not that they have usually
a narrative form. There are also among the Spanish
and Portuguese eclogues, many poems which present
the same character as these pictures of amatory aspiration.
Barbosa Bacellar seems to have conferred on
these pictures the highest degree of improvement which
they were capable of receiving, consistently with fidelity
to the style, which was then exclusively appropriated
to the poetry of love in Spain and Portugal. But the
modern forms of cultivation have given, at least on this
side of the Pyrenees, a direction so totally different to
poetic susceptibility, that the endless complaining of
lovers must soon become tedious even to the readers
most disposed to indulge in such romantic sentiments.
It is, however, a remarkable circumstance in the history
of the human mind, that the Portuguese taste in the
seventeenth century fondly dwelt on every little feature
of such never-ending repetitions in the expression of
the same feeling. Barbosa Bacellar devoted no small
portion of labour to every line in his <i>Saudades</i>. He
is particularly successful in imparting a graceful colouring
to the romantic conversations in which the
solitary lover engages with natural objects.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>


<h3 id="Torrezao_Coelho_295">TORREZAÕ COELHO.</h3>

<p>A doctor of canon law, and a member of the
Inquisitorial college of Lisbon, named Simaõ Torrezaõ
Coelho, vied with Barbosa Bacellar in this new modification
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
of romantic poetry. His pictures of passion
are, however, totally different from those of Bacellar.
He imitated the perverted style of the Marinists and
Gongorists, and followed the precepts of Faria e Sousa.
He talks of “the just sensation of unjust love;”<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a>&mdash;of the
living feeling of a dead soul;<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> of “the memory that
lives in the brass of the soul;”<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> and such like Marinisms
and Gongorisms. His verses appear, however, to have
been very popular.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>


<h3 id="Freire_de_Andrada_296">FREIRE DE ANDRADA.</h3>

<p>Jacinto Freire de Andrade or Andrada, an ecclesiastic,
who performed a part in the political history of
his native country, and nearly fell a sacrifice to the
patriotism with which he defended the claims of the
house of Braganza against the Spanish occupation of
the Portuguese throne, also endeavoured to enlarge the
boundaries of comic poetry. Wit so highly cultivated
had never before shewn itself in Portuguese verse. In
the union of bold sportiveness, sustained humour and
poignant satire, with perfect correctness and elegance of
language, Andrada’s burlesque narratives of the fable of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
Narcissus, and the fable of Polyphemus and Galathæa,<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a>
excel all the earlier specimens of comic wit which the
works of former Portuguese poets, including even the
comedies, afford. The burlesque manner of Andrada
is owing solely to a caricature style which he took no
pains to avoid. From the introductory stanzas to his
Polyphemus, it appears that he merely tried to divert
himself by these plays of fancy, in the hope of forgetting
the adversities of his life. He wished, he says,
“to visit the region of folly, that he might thereby
approach happiness.” He also observes, that “with
three ounces of judgment he is more loaded than an
elegy, and more solemnly sententious than a sonnet.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>
In order to cheat his sorrow, he makes “joy play
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
with false dice.”<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> Had Andrada thrown these dice
more steadily, he would, without doubt, have been one
of the first comic writers in narrative poetry. But his
satire was chiefly directed against the affected poetry
of the Gongorists. He attacked other follies merely
incidentally as they happened to strike him, and while
he was in the humour rather to jest than to castigate.</p>

<p>In his <i>Narcissus</i>, he begins with parodying the
wild conceits and romantic imagery of the fantastic
sonneteers. To explain whence the beauty of Narcissus
originates, a minute detail is given of the charms of his
mother, the nymph Liriope, to whom the river god Cephissus
makes tender propositions. After describing how
the nymph paints herself in the morning, it is said of her
eyes “that for boldness and honour there are no fairer
lights in heaven; that they are pirates rebelliously fallen
from the sun, which now, like the Dutch, wage war
against the stars.”<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> Of the lips of the beauteous nymph
he says, that they make “the roses wither for envy.”<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a>
The declaration of love, put into the mouth of Cephissus
in this parodying style, is still more whimsical. If, says
he, the eyes of the nymph should summon him to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
battle, he must be immediately subdued, because he
should “see the sun divided in two eyes.”<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> He conjures
her not to destroy the paper on which he has written
his declaration of love, as in that case she will destroy
“the house in which she dwells; and the altar on
which she is worshipped.”<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> He now begins to weep
bitterly, upon which Liriope observes, that if he be a
true lover, the fountain of his tears must never dry up;
but that it would be better to begin by giving her a
little present, and to let “the sin go first and the tears
follow afterwards.”<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> Andrada’s conceits, though they
sometimes consist of mere plays of words, are still not
of a common kind; as when he makes the covetous
nymph say, that, “the demon of the flesh, flies
frightened from the cross, but clings to the crossed;”<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a>
and that of “all beautiful streams none murmur so
sweetly as the Silver River (the Rio de la Plata in
South America).” At length the nymph resigns herself
to the river god, and he becomes the reputed father of
Narcissus. The reader is next entertained with a comic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
biography of Narcissus, which is a satirical representation
of the history of a fashionable beau. Before he
quits the cradle he is destined to become a military
officer, as it is discovered that he was born “in the
sign of the lion, though it was really the sign of the
bull.”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> The officer when grown up is characterized as
one who though <i>choleric</i>, is never <i>sanguine</i> (sanguinary);
who has “sinned against the fifth commandment in
word but not in deed;<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> and who has always displayed
great gallantry in engagements with the wine flasks.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a>”
Tired of the army, he applies himself to poetry, and
writes a new Jerusalem Delivered, and some sonnets in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
which the sun is so frequently introduced, that the
absurdity of the conceits or <i>disparates</i> is, as it is said,
rendered quite transparent. Narcissus also becomes
fond of tracing genealogies, but he considers it beneath
his dignity to study law, or to endeavour to acquire any
other kind of practical knowledge. Being convinced by
the heralds of his distinguished extraction, he withdraws
himself from the public eye; but at the same time takes
a lively interest in all that occurs at court, and soon
becomes a minister of state. The love of wealth being
now his governing passion, he rapidly enriches himself
at the expense of the nation, and at last dies of vanity.</p>

<p>What this satire occasionally wants in refinement,
is compensated by its extraordinary features, in which
Andrada’s wit shines with peculiar lustre: and though
the comic effusions of the ingenious author can only
rank as poetic trifles, they are nevertheless entitled to
some attention in consequence of their being chiefly
directed against the absurd style which then distinguished
and disfigured Spanish and Portuguese
literature.</p>

<p>Andrada’s Polyphemus is a direct ridicule of the
monstrous production of Gongora which bears the same
title. As an example of the kind of ridicule employed
it may just be mentioned, that in this parody the Cyclops
styles the conquering eyes of Galathæa, “Turks by land
and Dutch by sea.” The poetic works of Andrada
include some comic sonnets and romances. He is also
the author of a still more remarkable prose work which
will be hereafter noticed.

<h3 id="Further_decline_302">FURTHER DECLINE OF PORTUGUESE TASTE&mdash;RIBEIRO
DE MACEDO&mdash;CORREA DE LA CERDA.</h3>

<p>During the second half of the seventeenth century,
until the period of the first imitation of the French
style in Portuguese literature, the defenders and partizans
of classic correctness in Portugal seem to have
been constantly diminishing. After the kingdom was
emancipated from Spanish dominion, the old patriotic
spirit of the Portuguese again found its way into their
poetry; but that poetry gained little thereby in interior
cultivation; and its boundaries were not farther extended.
A species of mythological tales in the romantic
form, but very dull and frigid, obtained some favour. In
this style did Duarte Ribeiro de Macedo, who was also
a prose author, and who died in the year 1682, after
filling several distinguished posts, relate the fable of
Adonis in serious redondilhas. Undismayed by the
ridicule with which Freire Andrada had overwhelmed
poems formed of such materials, he says in his verses
that “Adonis has obtained privileges from Cupid, and
licences from Diana, for punishing wild beasts and
enchanting the fair; that lightnings flash from his
eyes, and arrows are shot from his hands; that the hills
and valleys at once represent lamentation and horror,
because in the former the beasts groan, and in the
latter the goddesses sigh.”<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>

<p>Fernaõ Correa de la Cerda, an ecclesiastic, who was
Bishop of Oporto, may also be numbered among the
versifiers of this class. In a sonnet on a lady who
died a few days after an eclipse of the sun, he thought
it pathetic to say, that “at the death of Phillis, the
whole celestial sphere must be afflicted with deep
sorrow, bitter anguish.” And then he asks “if <i>an
eclipsed</i> sun excites so much regret, what is to be
expected from <i>a dead</i> sun?”<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>


<h3 id="Violante_do_Ceo_304">VIOLANTE DO CEO.</h3>

<p>A poetess whose name and rank probably contributed
to raise her reputation at this period, shone conspicuously
among the writers whom Freire de Andrada ridiculed.
She was called Violante do Ceo, that is, if a name
may be translated, “Violante of Heaven.” As a nun
of the order of Dominicans, she obtained the character
of a pattern of piety. Portuguese writers, moreover
mention, that she was an excellent performer on the
harp, and a singer. Among her writings there are some
spiritual meditations in prose. She was born in 1601,
and died in 1693, having consequently attained the age
of ninety-two. Her miscellaneous poems were for the
first time collected after her death.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> Violante do Ceo
was certainly a woman of genius; but her genius had
received a totally false cultivation. She delighted as
much as any of the partizans of Faria e Sousa, in all
the absurdities of Portuguese Gongorism and Marinism.
With her no antithesis was too far-fetched, no play
of words too trivial, if the idea she thereby expressed
was, according to her opinion, extraordinary. When
wanting a poetic image, she immediately has recourse to
the sun, which constantly shines in her pages as in
these of the other Portuguese Gongorists and Marinists,
whose verses, on that account, were by the witty
Andrada, pronounced transparent. The tenderness or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
warmth of feeling which in female poetry often gets the
better of the judgment, is in the writings of Violante
do Ceo unnaturally represented by a false overstrained
wit, which, however, assumes the disguise of judgment.
In a sonnet on a lady, named Marianna de Luna,
Violante do Ceo apostrophizes the muses, as “the divinities,
who, in the garden of the king of day, unloosing
their sweet voices, arrest Zephyr;&mdash;who, admiring the
thoughts, multiply the flowers which Apollo creates.”
She implores the muses “to abandon the society of the
sun, since a moon (that is to say, Marianna de <i>Luna</i>,)
which is at once a sun and a prodigy, prepares for them
a garden of harmony.” Whether Marianna de Luna
was a musician, or whether she had really laid out a
fine garden, is not clearly explained. After some unintelligible
phrases, it is in conclusion declared, that
“through the grace of the deity, this tuneful garden is
secured by the immortal wall of eternity.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> In this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
spirit and style Violante do Ceo composed both sacred
and profane poetry. One of her Spanish sonnets on the
death of a lady, closes with the idea, that, “if <i>for such
a sun</i> the world is the region of setting, heaven on the
other hand is <i>for such a sun</i> (the words are expressly
repeated) the region of rising.”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> She addressed a similar
sonnet to a physician, named Arraes, a word which in
the Portuguese language signifies the master of a vessel;
and she says, in allusion to his name, that he deserves
to be captain of the ship of life, which navigates the
ocean of tyrannic disease; that is to say, as the
succeeding lines denote, that he ought to be the king’s

<h3 id="Didactic_epistles_307">DIDACTIC EPISTLES OF ALVARES DA CUNHA.</h3>

<p>Of the extent to which the perverted taste, which
in the seventeenth century disfigured Portuguese, even
more than Spanish poetry influenced the didactic epistolary
style, a judgment may be formed by reference to
the writings of Antonio Alvares da Cunha. This
author, one of the most distinguished statesmen and
literary characters of the reigns of John IV. and Alphonso
VI. addressed epistles to Joaõ Nunez da Cunha,
who was appointed viceroy of the Portuguese dominions
in India. To express the trivial idea of Nunez da
Cunha being about to sail from Lisbon for India,
Alvares da Cunha pompously says, that the new viceroy
will cut through “the crystal waves from the mouth
of the Tagus, to those new regions which the world
descried by the waving of the <i>Quinas</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> The time of
the sailing of the ship is described as the time during
which the viceroy’s “winged beachen trees spread their
pinions, carrying with them the wind, while they pursue
their silvery path.” He next regrets that the instrument
with which he writes does not perfectly express
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
his ideas, observing “that though the pen touch softly
the guitar of the paper, rude thunder resounds from
that guitar.”<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> This epistle is one of the longest in
Portuguese literature; and though totally deficient in
the true epistolary character, it nevertheless contains
many good ideas and sound precepts, while at the same
time it exhibits a vain display of historical erudition.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></p>


<h3 id="Jeronymo_Bahia_308">JERONYMO BAHIA.</h3>

<p>The taste of the public was, in like manner, corrupted
by Jeronymo Bahia, of whose existence in other
respects no account is preserved.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> The old fable of
Polyphemus and Galathæa had already been so completely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
exhausted, that a recurrence to it might have
been expected rather to disgust than to please; and yet,
as if a new relation of that wearisomely repeated story
had been all that was necessary to establish a writer
on a level with Gongora, Jeronymo Bahia collected a
store of affected phrases, and with pompous gravity
remodelled the often celebrated theme of the Cyclops
and his disdainful mistress.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> Thus powerless had been
all the pointed satire of the more judicious party. Divested
of its original heaviness, and united with the fanciful
Marinism, Gongorism now seemed to its defenders
to be raised above the reach of ridicule. Bahia, too,
thought it, perhaps, the less necessary to guard against
the wit of the adverse party, since he was himself a
master in subtle witticism. He wrote numerous comic
romances, that is to say, comic tales and descriptions of
travels in redondilhas. His playful loquacity flows in an
inexhaustible current in these romances, which are not
destitute of comic interest; but their extreme length
would still have rendered them tedious, even though the
author had better succeeded in catching the gay style
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
suited to such trivial compositions.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> His great facility
in rhyming is recorded in a notice affixed to one of his
odes. This ode was written on a victory gained by the
Portuguese during their war with Spain, and Bahia
composed it in a single day, so that it was presented to
the king on the evening of the day on which the account
of the battle was circulated. Surely no other manufacturer
of rhyme would, like him, have spun out an
<i>Idyllio panegyrico</i>, on a chandelier, which the Duchess
of Savoy presented to the Queen of Portugal, to fifty
octavo pages of versified prattle. From the works of
this author may also be incidentally learned the direction
which the prevailing spirit of religion took in
Portugal, when the old national energy expired, and
when the still more remarkable decline of the Spanish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
monarchy enabled the Portuguese to maintain an eight-and-twenty
years war against Spain, in defence of their
recovered independence. It was at this period that
the court of Lisbon resorted to the far-famed expedient
of enlisting by prayers and entreaties Saint Anthony
among the Portuguese troops, and formally investing
him with the military rank of generalissimo, in order
to render the army invincible. The inhabitant of
heaven was declared to have accepted the command,
and Jeronymo Bahia wrote a song of praise in honour
of King Alphonso VI. who effected this extraordinary
arrangement.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></p>


<h3 id="Francisco_Vasconcellos_311">FRANCISCO VASCONCELLOS.</h3>

<p>The dominion of bad taste and worthless subtilty
was not, however, during the second half of the seventeenth
century extended over the whole of the Portuguese
Parnassus. The writings of some poets still
evinced sound judgment and some portion of the old
and nobler style of art. Francisco de Vasconcellos of
the island of Madeira, inclined somewhat more to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
side of reason than most of his contemporaries.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> Some
of his sonnets are so free from unnatural and overstrained
thoughts,<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> that one might be induced to
consider his other productions as parodied imitations
in the style of Andrada, were it not that these outbalance
the number of his correct poems, and that his
works include a new dressing of the long before overdone
story of Polyphemus and Galatæa.</p>


<h3 id="Telles_da_Sylva_312">TELLES DA SYLVA AND NUNES DA SYLVA.</h3>

<p>Antonio Telles da Sylva was likewise distinguished
among the multitude of sonneteers by a better cultivated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
taste.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> He also composed latin verses, though
he was <i>gentil-homem da camara</i> (a gentleman of the
chamber).</p>

<p>But a greater share of attention is due to the poems
of Andre Nunes da Sylva, an equally unassuming and
ingenious writer, who received his first education in
Brazil, and who died a Theatin monk in Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> His
spiritual sonnets, canções, and romances, are at least
free from absurd conceits and Marinistical subtilties.
It was, however, scarcely possible at any time, but more
especially at the period of the most violent re-action
against protestantism, not to deviate from reason, in representing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
poetically, and with religious fervour, the mysteries
of the catholic faith, according to the opinions alone
considered orthodox in Portugal and Spain. Nevertheless
among the spiritual poems of Nunes da Sylva there
are some, which though certainly as romantic as pious,
are by no means fantastic, and which may be ranked
among the best of their kind.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> Even where the pious
writer appears to have fallen into the most extravagant
metaphors of the Marinists, as when he styles the tomb
of St. Isabella “a flower of the firmament, a star of the
field;” or, shortly after, “a nightingale, an animated
jewel, an Orpheus to the ear, and a flower to the eye,”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a>
his eccentric plays of ideas have still a poetic keeping.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
Among the patriotic poems, to which the war with
Spain gave birth, there are several by Nunes da Sylva,
which are distinguished for correct and picturesque
representation, at least in single passages;<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> and his
sonnets and songs of love possess, with all their faults,
a considerable portion of poetic tenderness.</p>


<h3 id="Other_sonneteers_315">OTHER SONNETEERS&mdash;CONTINUED INTERVENTION
OF THE SPANISH LANGUAGE IN PORTUGUESE
POETRY.</h3>

<p>It is not necessary to enter into particular details
respecting other Portuguese sonneteers. Some who
enjoyed celebrity lived until the commencement of the
eighteenth century, among whom the names of Diogo
de Monroy e Vasconcellos, Thomas de Sousa, and Luis
Simoes de Azavedo, deserve to be mentioned. About
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
the same period lived Diogo Camacho, who was the
author of a lively poem, entitled a Journey to Parnassus;
the idea of which was doubtless taken from the
work of Cervantes of the same name, but which when
compared with that master-piece, possesses no great merit.
On comparing the Portuguese sonnets, the authors
of which lived till the eighteenth century, with those of
a somewhat older date, an obvious, though certainly not
a striking tendency of Portuguese taste, to a more correct
direction of the imagination, is, upon the whole,
perceptible. But how far this change in Portuguese
literature was effected by the increasing influence of
French taste, which about this time commenced its
universal sway; or whether it is at all attributable
to the introduction of that taste, are questions not easy
to be decided. This, however, is certain, that the incorrect,
silly, and fantastic style of writing and judging
poetry, still maintained its ground in the Portuguese literature
of the eighteenth century long after the Count de
Ericeira, who will soon be further noticed, had drawn
from the school of Boileau those principles by which he
wished to improve the literary taste of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Of the Portuguese sonneteers, who more or less
contributed to transfuse the style of the seventeenth
into the eighteenth century, there was none who did
not, according to the custom of the age, pride himself
in his facility of composing verses in the Spanish language.
The recent separation of Portugal from the
Spanish monarchy, had not, in the least, diminished
this old custom of the Portuguese poets. They addressed
complimentary verses in Spanish to the Queen of Portugal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
Spanish comedies were still represented in Lisbon;
and even the <i>loas</i>, or prologues, were recited in
the same language. It was not until the esteem for
Spanish literature had declined throughout Europe, that
the literature of Portugal became entirely Portuguese.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p>It is proper to observe here, that the collections of
Portuguese poems of the seventeenth century, likewise
contain sonnets by a Prince Don Pedro, and by several
anonymous ladies.</p>


<h3 id="Portuguese_eloquence_317">PORTUGUESE ELOQUENCE DURING THE SEVENTEENTH
CENTURY.</h3>

<p>All that need be said respecting the Portuguese
eloquence of the seventeenth century, may be related
within the compass of a few pages. The obstacles
which had hitherto impeded the free cultivation of
energetic and reasoning prose in Portuguese literature,
operated still more fatally, when the restraints on conscience
became more oppressive, and when there was
no longer any feeling of political greatness to give
excitement to the thinking mind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>


<h3 id="Romantic_prose_318">ROMANTIC PROSE&mdash;MATHEUS RIBEYRO&mdash;CASTANHEIRA
TURACEM.</h3>

<p>Viewed in relation to the whole of Portuguese literature,
romantic prose continued nearly on the same
footing on which it long had stood. It maintained its
ground; but it was long after the death of Rodriguez
Lobo before any more distinguished writer in this class
of composition arose. With regard to invention, however,
some of the Portuguese romances of the seventeenth
century are not without merit. This praise is
due to a work written by Matheus Ribeyro, a priest,
who did not scruple to publish his name on the title-page,
together with an enumeration of all his ecclesiastical
dignities. This romance, which is entitled,
“Retirement from Care, or the Life of Carlos and
Rosaura,”<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> is not wanting in adventures both by sea
and land. The style, however, is that of the old
romance, with all its excrescences, and is particularly
fantastical in the descriptive passages.</p>

<p>But a more elegant and far more valuable production
of fancy now demands some notice. That this
work was written with the view of opposing fantastic
ornament in polite literature, and of assisting to restore
a more natural and dignified spirit and style, would never
be suspected from its affected title, which, stripped of
its antiquated form, means, as far as it can be rendered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
intelligible, “The elegant Evening Party, or the Improvement
of Bad Manners.”<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> On the title-page, and
at the close of the dedicatory address, the author styles
himself Felix da Castanheira Turacem. No information
respecting him, beyond what his work affords,
seems to have been preserved; but from that it may be
concluded that he was a man who moved in the more
elevated and polished ranks of society. The bad custom
which he particularly condemned was an improper extension
of the liberty taken at the season of the carnival
in Lisbon. To present a picture of a more
elegant and noble style of social entertainment, he
contrasts the sprightly conversation of the company,
whose manners he describes, with the licentious tricks
of the carnival (<i>entrudo</i>.) The plan of Castanheira’s
work is similar to that of Rodriguez Lobo’s “Court in
the Country;” but the composition possesses a higher
degree of romantic interest. In the party which Castanheira
assembles, beautiful women play prominent
parts; and between them and the young gentlemen
who most contribute to the entertainment, attachments
are formed which cross and oppose each other. The
characters by turns sing, play, tell stories, and converse.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
The composition is, upon the whole, equally graceful
and natural; but the execution is in many passages
less successful. Castanheira, particularly where he begins
to describe, is often drawn unconsciously into the stream
of Gongorism and Marinism, though it appears that he
was really anxious to separate himself completely from
the partisans of these styles. That this was his most
serious determination, is obvious from his spirited preface,
in which he acknowledges that he does not calculate
on a very favourable reception in the polite world.
He declares that he is not ambitious of the honour of
writing verses extempore. He sought to steer clear of
dulness and bombast, the Scylla and Charybdis of the
wide ocean of eloquence; and in all his digressions never
to lose sight of the haven of clearness, as its entrance
is difficult. “But deliver us from metaphor,” he adds
in latin, and in the words of the Lord’s Prayer.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> A
man who, at this period, could so express himself in
Portugal, deserves, were it on that account only, to be
distinguished in the history of polite literature. Castanheira’s
language, too, is, upon the whole, as natural
according to the manner of its cultivation, as is his lively
descriptive art. It is singular, however, that occasionally
in the course of his work, and sometimes in those very
passages, the superiority of which would otherwise be
unquestionable, he falls into the very faults which he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
himself ridicules.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> On the novel style, which is discussed
in the first evening party, Cervantes appears, by
that time, to have exercised a favourable influence. The
severe criticism on the <i>Poesia Incuravel</i> (Incurable
Poetry), in the second evening’s conversation, is certainly
the best theoretical disquisition on Gongorism
and Marinism, to be found in the Portuguese literature
of the seventeenth century. It ought, also, to be
stated, that the sonnets and other poems which are
scattered through the work, exhibit some very successful
passages. Occasion is taken to introduce a
<i>Discurso Academico</i>, which towards the conclusion
refers to the Italian academic system, which had long
been imitated in Portugal, but which proved of as
little advantage to Portuguese as to Italian literature.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
Among the poems comprised in this book, there are
many in the Spanish language.</p>


<h3 id="Historical_prose_322">HISTORICAL PROSE&mdash;FREIRE DE ANDRADA.</h3>

<p>Of the cultivation of prose style in Portuguese literature
during the seventeenth century, nothing could
be said, had not a man in whom the spirit of the
sixteenth century survived, successfully pursued the
path which Barros and Brito traced out. This writer,
who must be regarded as single in his age, was Jacinto
Freire de Andrada, the same who in his comic tales
already noticed, ridiculed the Gongorism and Marinism
of poetry. The reader is almost inclined to doubt the
evidence of his own eyes, when, among the Portuguese
writings of the seventeenth century, he discovers
such a prose work as “the Life of Dom Joaõ de Castro,
fourth Viceroy of India, by Freire de Andrada.”<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> No
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
biographical work, deserving to be ranked on a level
with this, had hitherto appeared either in Portuguese
or any other modern language. Andrada is reproached
with a certain degree of far-fetched elegance and refined
subtlety; and certainly his historical style might often,
with advantage, be more simple. But that this ingenious
writer upon the whole entertained the most correct
notion of the rhetorical cultivation of historical prose,
and that his intention was to write an energetic style
appropriate to his subject, but by no means to make
an ostentatious display of elegant phrases, would be
sufficiently evident from the character of the whole
work, even though the author had not, in his brief
preface, explained himself with sufficient clearness on
this point. He observes, that he has written his book
in the language of truth, and according to credible
authorities. He neither followed the advice of some
who recommended the extension of his work, nor
adopted the opinion of others who wished him to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
sacrifice the truth of nature to the fashionable ornaments of
affected cultivation. His object was not to
flatter a corrupt taste; on the contrary he wished to
merit, by the unadorned language of truth, the approbation
of sensible readers, rather than to gain a
name among the great mass of a mis-judging public.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a>
To a man of Andrada’s cultivated mind, it never could
appear that the duty of a faithful historian required
him to write in the chronicle style, as a means of
thereby ensuring historical truth. When he took up the
pen he felt that a demand was made upon him for the
exercise of intellectual powers. His biography of Joaõ
de Castro was to be a monument in honour of that
distinguished man. Andrada, therefore, devoted no less
attention to the representation than to the distribution
of the materials of his narrative. To all appearance he
did not form his style on that of any particular author
of antiquity, but he makes nearer approaches to Sallust
than to any other; and the influence which the study of
the classics must have had on the literary education
of Andrada, is sufficiently obvious. His turn for wit
occasionally led him to express himself in antitheses of
too poignant a character; but in every other respect his
narrative style possesses the clearness, precision, lightness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
and moreover the deep interest of the classic prose
of antiquity. It is only necessary to read the commencement
of this biography, to enter immediately into
the spirit of the whole work.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> Andrada’s appropriate
diction never resolves into merely elegant prolixity;
and whatever be the degree of polish it receives, its
character is generally unassuming. In the biographical
arrangement of the events, little historical art is observable,
but a clear practical understanding is displayed
throughout the whole work. The character of Joaõ
de Castro is exhibited even in the first accounts given
of his childhood and education. The reader afterwards
finds it developed with farther precision, but without
any appearance of being again obtruded by the historian.
The dark side, which, however, should never be
wanting in an historical picture, is left by Andrada to
the imagination of his readers. But the intuitive power
displayed in the representation of the events, which is
naturally and nowhere poetically adorned, leaves nothing
to be wished for in this biographical work.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> Andrada
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
also proved himself a disciple of the classic school by
his predilection for the ancient custom of enlivening the
narrative, and augmenting the interest of the subject,
by speeches attributed to the principal personages who
figure in the work. These are sometimes delivered
by Joaõ de Castro himself, and more frequently by his
most dangerous but interesting enemy, Coge Cofar, the
general in chief of the Mussulmans in India. Some of
these speeches are decidedly excellent, but others are
rather artificial.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> Towards the close of the biography
where documents are interpolated, the story loses
some portion of its deep interest. It was by no means
a happy idea to add to this work an appendix, which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
intended as a summary recapitulation of the whole; and
at the same time as a supplemental picture of the character
of Joaõ de Castro, whose character is sufficiently
portrayed in the narrative of his achievements.</p>

<p id="Portuguese_treatises_327">Treatises in the Portuguese language, intended for

the seventeenth century. Practically cultivated taste
and critical tact, without which the art of poetry and
rhetoric degenerates into useless scholastic theory, must,
to men like Freire Andrada, in a great measure have
supplied the place of systematic rules.

<h3 id="Preliminary_observations_328">PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.</h3>

<p>The third period of Portuguese poetry and eloquence
arises so imperceptibly out of the second, that
no particular date, or remarkable event in Portuguese
literature can be said to form a dividing point between
them. The influence of the French taste on the Portuguese
is the characteristic mark of the commencement
of this last period. But even that influence never
produced any thing like a revolution in the state of
polite learning in Portugal. French taste worked
its way into the language and the literature of the
Portuguese, as tranquilly as into their manners. It
therefore neither forcibly supplanted the old taste, nor
caused any conflict of literary factions at all resembling
that warfare, which arose between the Gallicists and
the adherents of the old style in Spain. Thus the
literature of Portugal, for the second time, asserted its
peaceful character. As in the sixteenth century no
Portuguese Boscan had to contend with an old romantic
party, so in the eighteenth century there arose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
no Portuguese Luzan to uphold the French taste by
methodical rules of art. There occurred, therefore, no
violent reaction of old patriotism against Gallicism, like
that experienced in Spanish literature. Under these circumstances
an opportunity was at last afforded for the
English taste also to operate quietly and imperceptibly
on that of the Portuguese. The historian, however,
who finds it necessary to fix on some particular point
for the commencement of this last principal division of
the history of Portuguese poetry and eloquence, is constrained
to take his departure from the change of political
relations, which has been the main cause of Portuguese
cultivation and literature becoming, in the
struggle between French and English tendencies, what
they now are. Towards the close of the seventeenth century,
those conflicting tendencies which have threatened
the very existence of the kingdom of Portugal, first
began to manifest themselves.</p>

CULTIVATION IN PORTUGAL DURING THIS
PERIOD.</span></h2>


<h3 id="Total_decay_329"><i>Total decay of Portuguese Literature towards the end of
the Seventeenth Century.</i></h3>

<p>In the year 1668, when the Spanish government
again recognized the independence of the Portuguese
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
monarchy, the difference between what that monarchy
had been, and what it then was, became palpable. It
appeared that even its new existence was not altogether
assured by the peace with Spain. The flame of patriotism
no longer glowed with its wonted ardour in
Portuguese breasts; and the hope of re-conquering those
territories in India of which the Dutch had obtained
possession was extinguished. The gold and diamond
mines, discovered in Brazil, offered, it is true, a compensation
for the lost sources of oriental wealth. But the
old spirit of national enterprise was no more, and the
people, as well as the government, wanted energy and
talent for the useful employment of treasures, from
which the commercial policy of England well knew
how to derive advantage. A general lethargy seemed
to overspread the nation; and towards the close of the
seventeenth century the effects of that lethargy became
no less manifest in the depression of literature than
in the decay of military and maritime power, of the
finances, and of all the branches of national industry.
On the breaking out of the war of the Spanish succession,
the court of Lisbon inclined sometimes to the
French, and sometimes to the English party; but while
the government thus wavered, and was at a loss what
to do, the nation seemed perfectly disposed to adopt
the manners introduced from France, and French literature
soon gained the same ascendancy in Portugal
as in the rest of Europe. But the Portuguese were
not, at that period, prepared to estimate the merits of
French literature. Those who moved in the polite
world learned to speak and read French, and to mutilate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
their mother tongue.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> But only a few individuals
of uncommon acquirements took pleasure in cultivating
their literary taste after French models. The majority
of the poets, or versifiers of Portugal were, properly
speaking, entirely destitute of taste.</p>

<p>In taking a comprehensive view of the state of
poetry and eloquence in Portugal, during the eighteenth
century, it will be proper to follow the thread of the
national annals; for the general history of this portion
of Portuguese literature resolves into about as many
sections as the number of the reigns into which the
political history of the country is divided. The period
was indeed now gone by in which the nation formed

<h3 id="Establishment_of_the_Portuguese_Academy_1714"><small>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PORTUGUESE ACADEMY
IN</small> 1714.</h3>

<p>During the forty-four years reign of John V.
namely, from 1705 to 1750, there was no want of
institutions, calculated to raise the nation to the point
of elevation whence it had fallen. For the polite literature
of Portugal a new era seemed to have commenced,
when, in the year 1714, an <i>Academia Portugueza</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
on the model of the French academy, was
established under the presidency of so accomplished a
man as the Count de Ericeyra. But we nowhere find
an account of any advantage which the language and
literature of Portugal derived from the labours of this
academy; and the establishment was soon so completely
neglected, that it is difficult to conjecture how and when
it sank into decay.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> Other academies on the Italian
plan had their rise and decline without producing any
beneficial results; while several Portuguese poets were
satisfied with the honour of admission into the Italian
academy of the Arcadians. The academy of history,
founded at Lisbon in 1720, also promised to be
useful to Portuguese eloquence, as well as to historical
science; but in the end little or nothing was effected
even by this institution. Besides, though the general
character of the Portuguese, which had always been
less fanatical than that of the Spaniards, appeared
about this period to become somewhat more liberal
in religious and ecclesiastical matters, that favourable
symptom was merely a consequence of the friendly
relations which Portugal was under the necessity of
maintaining with England; and these relations seemed
to place Portugal too much in a state of dependence, to
be flattering to the national feeling, or to reanimate it
by the diffusion of knowledge. The inquisition, too,
continued to adopt the old precautions against all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
attempts at free-thinking, after the manner of Voltaire.
It was, therefore, neither the spirit of the old nor of
the new age, which, in the reign of John V. sometimes
maintained the ancient forms in Portuguese poetry and
eloquence, and sometimes endeavoured to introduce new
ones. This fluctuation was merely the result of a
feeble wavering between the old Portuguese, the
French, and the Italian taste. The better poetry was,
however, still to be found in the works of the authors,
who remained faithful to the ancient manner.</p>


<h3 id="Administration_333">ADMINISTRATION OF THE MARQUIS OF POMBAL.</h3>

<p>The twenty-six years reign of Joseph Emanuel, from
1750 to 1777, proved more salutary for the Portuguese
nation. The rigid despotism of the powerful
Marquis de Pombal, who in the name of the king ruled
with unlimited sway, left unpleasant recollections in
the minds of a portion of the nation. Nevertheless the
spirit of the higher nobility and of the ecclesiastics was
not wholly subdued by his measures. In the dungeons
which were filled with state prisoners, it is possible
that some men of talent languished. But Pombal’s
iron arm roused the slumbering nation. The despotic
system of government adopted by this state reformer,
who was, perhaps, only cruel from necessity, was an
enlightening system, and his object was to restore the
ancient glory of the Portuguese name. To literature
he attached but little immediate importance. But he
crippled the spiritual despotism, which held captive the
last remnant of Portuguese energy. Europe is mainly
indebted to him for the suppression of the order of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
jesuits; and the Portuguese, in particular, have to thank
him for that revived feeling of independence which soon
penetrated into their literature. A taste for the fine
arts, for philosophy, and literary cultivation, became
fashionable in Portugal. The connexion with England
proved, in some respects, advantageous to the new
progress of Portuguese genius, and promoted literary
improvement; for the Gallicists lost a considerable
portion of their political ascendancy, when English
literature began to be properly estimated in Portugal.</p>


<h3 id="Revived_spirit_334">REVIVED SPIRIT OF LITERATURE&mdash;UTILITY OF THE
PORTUGUESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.</h3>

<p>It was not until after the death of King Joseph
Emanuel, that the change which had taken place in
Portugal became fully manifest. Pombal’s institutions
seemed indeed destined to be annihilated, when his
enemies triumphed. But even the new degree of favour
which the clergy enjoyed in the reign of the pious
Queen Maria, had not the effect of stifling the revived
spirit of improvement in Portugal. Young Portuguese
travelled to several parts of Europe and carried back
to their native country the fruits of modern cultivation.
The Prince Regent loved and favoured literature.
In the course of a few years the Royal Academy
of Sciences at Lisbon did much to rouse the nation to
new activity, and in particular to reconcile philosophic
study with enlightened views of national interest. Had
that excellent institution, especially as it existed under
the judicious guidance of the Duke of Lofoens, been
left undisturbed in the pursuit of its glorious and successful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
labours, the benefits produced to Portugal would
have been more extensive and direct than those which
most of the European academies have conferred on the
countries to which they belong. The cosmopolite observer
will, doubtless, be less interested in what the
academy accomplished for polite literature, than in its
zealous exertions for the encouragement of science, the
diffusion of just and liberal ideas, and the consequent
improvement of national industry and public prosperity.
This institution was, however, of important
service to polite literature. Prizes were offered for the
best comedy and the best tragedy, to be written in
the Portuguese language. It was endeavoured, through
the influence of some of the academicians, to restore
to due consideration the Portuguese classic writers of
the sixteenth century, and also to re-introduce the
language of that better period into literature, and the
business of common life. Some volumes of academic
transactions, which have in furtherance of this object
been published since the year 1792, contain, in imitation
of the French manner, essays purely literary,
interspersed with articles on national history. This
was, however, only a harmless blending of heterogeneous
subjects; and the recollections of ancient times to which
it gave birth, contributed to recall to Portuguese poetry
and eloquence some portion of the old national spirit,
from the revival of which the general interests of the
country had every thing to expect<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a>.

<span class="large">HISTORY OF PORTUGUESE POETRY DURING THIS
PERIOD.</span></h2>


<h3 id="The_Conde_da_Ericeyra_336">THE CONDE DA ERICEYRA.</h3>

<p>The first Portuguese poet remarkable for paying
homage to the French taste, was the ingenious and
meritorious Francisco Xavier de Menezes, Conde da
Ericeyra, born in 1673. The family rank of this writer
doubtless added to the celebrity of the talents by which
he distinguished himself at an early period of life. This
will account for the extraordinary circumstance, that
while yet in the twentieth year of his age he was
elected president of one of the academies which were
founded in Lisbon, on the model of those of Italy. He
is said to have spoken the Latin, Spanish, Italian and
French languages with facility. He made, however, no
progress in Greek. At an early age he translated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
Boileau’s Art of Poetry into Portuguese octaves; and
from that period he maintained a friendly intercourse
with the French critic. Literary and more particularly
poetical studies continued to occupy him even during
the Spanish war of succession, in which he made several
campaigns. He rose in the Portuguese army to the rank
of <i>mestre do campo</i> (major general.) The consideration
and influence which the Count da Ericeyra enjoyed in
Portuguese literature, were rapidly augmented by the
authority attached to the offices which he filled; for in
the year 1714, he was appointed rector and secretary of
the Portuguese academy which was then founded; and
in the year 1721, co-director of the new academy of history.
His literary reputation soon extended beyond the
narrow limits of Portugal; and during the latter half
of his life, he held a conspicuous place among the men
of his age, whose talents had given them a general
celebrity. He maintained a correspondence with learned
foreigners both in the south and north of Europe. The
Pope and the King of France bestowed on him particular
marks of their esteem; and the transactions of
the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences were formally
transmitted to him by that learned body. In his
old age this diligent writer bestowed the greatest share
of his attention on an epic poem, entitled, the <i>Henriqueida</i>,
in which he endeavoured, as far as possible, to
fulfil all the conditions of poetic art, according to the
principles of the most celebrated critics. It would
appear that he completed his task in the year 1738,
and at the age of sixty-nine he enjoyed the satisfaction
of seeing his work printed. He died two years afterwards.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
The number of his works, both in verse and
prose, is considerable; and it seems that many of them
still remain unprinted.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<p id="General_character_338">The poetical works of the Count da Ericeyra, among
which are several in the Spanish language, are distinguished
by a degree of polish in which it is impossible
not to recognise the disciple and admirer of Boileau.
But this nobleman was not destined to mark an epoch
in Portuguese poetry. To regard him as a mere Gallicist
would be extremely unjust, and to rank him
among poets in the highest and strictest sense of the
term, would be to form an equally erroneous judgment of
poetic art. Ericeyra certainly was not a slavish imitator
of the French style. He endeavoured to form his talent
by the study of all the works which he conceived fitted to
serve as models whatever might be the language in which
they were written; and this spirit of liberality in literary
cultivation was a peculiarly estimable trait in his
character. In the metrical structure, as well as in the
style of his poems, he remained faithful to the forms
and spirit of the old Portuguese national poetry, and
to the school of the sixteenth century. But with all
his plastic capabilities, he was wanting in creative fancy;
and with all his endeavours to attain classic correctness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
he did not avoid faults, which are readily pardoned
in the works of the older Portuguese poets, in consideration
of the poetic energy which is manifest in those
very faults. In that poetic energy all the writings of
the Count da Ericeyra are deficient. His imagination,
which never of itself took a lofty flight, was much
more inclined to enlarge artificially upon any pleasing
subject, than to seize with inspiration and freely fashion
a subject of its own; and the rules of French criticism
doubtless contributed to allure him to the cultivated
occasional style, as that style may justly be denominated,
which, whenever the opportunity for an occasional
poem offers, is always at the command of a
writer possessing no common share of descriptive talent.
Accordingly not a few occasional poems are to be found
in the works of the Count da Ericeyra. In compliance
with the old Portuguese custom, he sometimes made
choice of the eclogue form, to record in a pleasing strain
of verse, certain events which occurred in the Royal
family. In this form, for example, he deplores, through
the medium of shepherds and shepherdesses, the death
of the Infante Dom Miguel, which took place in the
year 1724. After what has already been said respecting
other works of this kind, to dwell longer on the
eclogues of the Count da Ericeyra would be a superfluous
labour; but in the history of Portuguese poetry,
the Henriqueida claims a more particular notice.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span></p>

<p id="His_Henriqueida_340">The Henriqueida may unquestionably be called an
epic poem with far more propriety than the <i>Condestabre
de Portugal</i> of Rodriguez Lobo.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> It is the work of an
industrious talent, which occasionally seizes, with happy
effect, a poetic situation, and by poetic handling elevates
a series of historical events, somewhat above the sphere
of prosaic nature. But this tedious and laboured poem
possesses no other merit. Neither in the invention, highly
as it has been esteemed, nor in the execution, which is not
wanting in incidental beauties, is there displayed any
thing like the captivating energy of the epic poetry of
Camoens; and even in correctness of ideas and images,
Ericeyra’s Henriqueida is very deficient. The subject
is patriotically chosen. Henry of Burgundy, the founder
of the Portuguese monarchy, is the hero of the poem.
The action is not destitute of intrinsic interest, and the
epic unity belonging to it has been happily caught by
Ericeyra. The poem is divided into twelve cantos.
Henry of Burgundy, the son-in-law of Alphonso VI.
King of Castile, receives the county of Portugal as a
fief, but on condition of first conquering that dowry,
and afterwards securing it by further conquests. At
the commencement of the poem the prince is waging
war against the Moorish King Muley; but there appears
little probability of the conquest of Lisbon, which is
still in the hands of the Moors. Henry is informed
that a Portuguese sybil lives somewhere in the vicinity
of the camp in a concealed cavern, which he determines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
to explore, and for that purpose withdraws unnoticed
from his army. The rashness with which this purpose
is executed, is more characteristic of a fool-hardy adventurer
than of a hero destined to be the founder of a
kingdom. After taking a desperate leap, he succeeds
in discovering the cavern and its inhabitant, who proves
to be a christian sybil. She reveals to him the secret
of his destination, together with some facts relative to
the future greatness of the nation. While he is
engaged in collecting this prophetic information, his
troops suppose him to be lost. The Moors attack; the
Christians are giving way; but at the critical moment
Henry arrives, and turns the tide of victory. This first
event, by which the interest of the epic action becomes
immediately attached to the hero of the poem, is succeeded
by a series of single combats, sieges, and victories,
interspersed with love adventures, and carried on
until the taking of Lisbon, with which exploit the poem
concludes. The distribution of the parts is managed
with much art, so that the characters in which it is
wished the reader should take an interest, appear one
after the other in their proper lights. The situations,
too, are for the most part well chosen. Prophetic
dreams, and a certain portion of fairyism still impart to
the tale the charm of the miraculous, even after the
christian sybil has divulged the general influence of the
celestial powers. But the Henriqueida is from the first
to the last canto destitute of that poetic warmth and
spirit, the absence of which cannot be supplied by the
ablest descriptive talent, and without which poetic
art degenerates into mere exercises of style; for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
industriously ingenious author was deficient in energy
and depth of natural feeling, as well as in purity of
ideal feeling. In his <i>advertencias preliminares</i>, or
theoretical introduction, Ericeyra declares that he has
in a certain measure endeavoured to imitate all epic
poets, and to imbibe a portion of the manner of each;
but had he withheld this acknowledgment no reader
acquainted with other epic poems, could have failed to
recognise in the Henriqueida the styles of Homer, Virgil,
Ariosto, Tasso, and progressively of Lucan, Silius Italicus,
and Statius, but without ever discerning the
animating spirit of genuine poetry. The tedious coldness
which pervades the whole poem destroys the effect
of those incidental beauties of style which it must be
allowed to possess. The very first stanzas give birth to an
unfavourable presage;<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> and to invoke the inspiration of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
the deity rather than the muses is but a frigid conceit.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a>
Even the descriptive passages, in which Ericeyra displays
most talent, are deteriorated by artificial traits
which launch into the region of Portuguese Marinism,
and betray all the coldness of study.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> Sometimes these
traits stand as abruptly forward as if they had been
interpolated by a sonnetist of the seventeenth century;
thus, in allusion to Henry of Burgundy’s descent into
the sybil’s cave amidst the fury of the conflicting elements,
it is said, that “the vivid flames of his heart
dried up the waves, and set fire to the winds.”<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
the assembled princes sit down to hear Henry relate
what he has seen in the cave, it is said of the plumes
of the military heroes, that “they wafted glorious deeds
to heaven, and inscribed victories without the aid of
letters.”<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> On another occasion, the author describes
the effect of a violent shout of the storming troops, by
saying, that “even the stones of the walls seemed touched
by the cry, and had nearly disclosed the medals which
their celebrated founders had buried beneath them.”<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a>
Among the poetic ornaments of Ericeyra’s narrative
style, the picturesque comparisons are for the most part
well conceived; but with all their truth they are deficient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
in poetic energy;<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> and sometimes, contrary to all
expectation, they terminate quite in the Marinistic
style.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> The Henriqueida is tolerably free of mythological
decoration. Still, however, Ericeyra could not
altogether refrain from availing himself of an ornament
which he considered so essential. He has, therefore,
contrary to all prosaic probability, for the violation of
which there is no adequate poetic motive, introduced a
Moorish princess in the character of a secret adherent
of the Greek mythology, and he has thus taken occasion
to describe a whole gallery of gods and goddesses.
At the conclusion of the poem, Ericeyra again summons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
all his powers of description, not entirely without success,
but still without avoiding those faults into which
his factitious enthusiasm had previously involved him.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></p>

<p>That such a poet as the Count da Ericeyra could, with
all his praiseworthy endeavours, succeed in restoring the
ancient glory of Portuguese poetry, or in giving a new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
direction to the poetic spirit of his nation, certainly
was not to be expected. But in consequence of his
labours it ceased to be taken for granted in Portugal,
that the mines of the higher poetry were exhausted,
and he contributed to encourage the idea of improvement
in poetic cultivation. His name, therefore, deserves
to be held in honourable recollection. What
benefits he, as a theorist, sought to impart to the poetic
art, shall be noticed in the next chapter.</p>


<h3 id="Continuance_of_347">CONTINUANCE OF CORRUPT TASTE IN PORTUGUESE
POETRY.</h3>

<h3>BARROS PEREIRA&mdash;ALEXANDRE ANTONIO DE LIMA.</h3>

<p>The age of the Count da Ericeyra presents, at its
close, a resting point in the history of Portuguese poetry,
which, if the numerical division of the years be not too
rigidly insisted on, may form a boundary between the
first and the second halves of the eighteenth century.
It was solely during the latter half that a favourable
change became obvious in the poetic cultivation of the
Portuguese. In the former half only a few Portuguese
poets of celebrity laboured to maintain a suitable connection
between the new and the old eras.</p>

<p>Among those poets it is not meant to include Father
Antonio de Lima Barros Pereira, who in the year 1720
published his spiritual and temporal works, under the
title of <i>Floresta Apollinea</i>, (Apollinian Flower-garden).
But this collection of miscellaneous poems ought to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
mentioned, as it serves to prove that in the beginning
of the eighteenth century the Spanish was the favourite
dramatic language in Lisbon. Among the works of
Barros Pereira, his <i>loas</i>, or allegorical preludes, are the
most numerous, and are all written in Spanish. Barros
Pereira also sought to distinguish himself by those
poetic rhapsodies without plan or object, which were,
both in Spain and Portugal, called <i>Sylvas</i> (Forests.)</p>

<p>The <i>Rasgos Metricos</i> (Metrical Fragments) of a
writer, named Alexandre Antonio de Lima, which were
printed in 1740, are likewise about equally divided
between the Portuguese and Spanish languages. The
title-page bears a dedication to St. Ann; and in the same
spirit which dictated that kind of address, the author,
who seems to have been of a sprightly humour, has
mingled spiritual and temporal productions together;
and he has sometimes made even pieces of the most
sacred character vehicles for jokes, which, however, are
meant to be pious after their own way.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> This singular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
incongruity was still considered inoffensive by the Portuguese
of that age. The miscellaneous poems of Antonio
de Lima are chiefly of a comic character. But a foreigner
who has never lived in Portugal will be unable to understand
most of this writer’s epigrammatic conceits, as they
all refer to particular customs and local relations.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> Some
of Antonio de Lima’s serious sonnets are by no means
contemptible productions.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> In satirical prose he attempted
an imitation of Quevedo’s visions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>


<h3 id="The_Portuguese_drama_350">THE PORTUGUESE DRAMA IN THE FIRST HALF OF
THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>


<h3 id="Spurious_dramas_350">SPURIOUS DRAMAS CALLED OPERAS.</h3>

<p>In the first half of the eighteenth century, a new,
though not a happy turn, became perceptible in the
dramatic poetry of the Portuguese. While the Spanish
drama still supplied the place of a Portuguese national
drama, the favour of the court of Lisbon was bestowed
on the Italian opera. The general approbation which
was soon extended to operatic performances of every
description, led to the introduction on the Portuguese
stage of a singular species of hybridous comedy. There
was a wish to naturalize the Italian opera; but it is
probable that few Portuguese singers were then capable
of executing recitative; and it may also be presumed,
that the Portuguese had heard of the little French
operas, in which the characters speak and sing alternately.
This, however, is certain, that the public of
Lisbon had always a strong predilection for comic entertainments;
and, it appears, that with the view of
fully satisfying the popular taste, it was thought advisable
to introduce the pomp of the serious Italian
opera into the comic drama of Portugal. By what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
practical head this idea was suggested no Portuguese
writer has thought fit to record. It seems not improbable
that it had its origin in the speculation of a theatrical
manager, who wished to venture on the experiment of
amusing the public in a new way; and who, for that
purpose, availed himself of the services of some obscure
writer, who happened to have a talent for dramatic
poetry. The first essays of this theatrical novelty were
all anonymous. It is, however, likely, that the result
greatly exceeded the expectation of the speculator.
The scenic decorations, in which the new species of
drama rivalled the Italian, the burlesque humour of the
pieces themselves, the effects of music, both vocal and
instrumental, captivated the great mass of the Lisbon
public. The higher ranks of society too, and even the
court, took an interest in these performances. New
dramas in this spirit and style followed each other in
rapid succession, more particularly during the ten years
which elapsed between 1730 and 1740. But no poet,
who had previously acquired reputation, appears to
have devoted himself to this kind of composition; and
the prolific dramatist, whose anonymous productions
were so fortunate as to obtain the chief favour of the
public, had probably at the time private reasons for
wishing to remain unknown. He was a Jew, whose
name, even after it was disclosed, was seldom mentioned,
as the public, content with the antonomasia, still continued
to call him <i>O Judeo</i>, (the Jew).<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

<p>The popularity of the new dramas soon became
so great, that manuscript copies were eagerly procured
for the purpose of private performance or reading.
From these copies collections were printed, the increase
of which fell still short of the public demand.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a>
To none of the dramas contained in these collections is
the name of an author affixed. In spirit and style
they so closely resemble each other, that they may all
be considered as the production of one individual. If
at this period French taste had acquired any decided
influence on Portuguese literature, such dramas, though
they might, for the sake of incident, music, and decoration,
have been tolerated on the stage, would never
have been sought for in print. It is impossible to imagine
a more rude combination of low jests, with romantic
and miraculous events, partly taken from real
history, and partly from the Greek and Roman mythology.
Had this strange compound been the workmanship
of cultivated as well as of inventive talent,
then, indeed, might the grotesque medley have been
rendered, by the ingenuity of composition, entertaining
even to readers of cultivated taste. But in these confused
jumbles, called comic operas, the composition is,
in general, as inartificial as the wit intended to enliven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
them is dull. The lowest buffoonery is blended with
singular adventures, tournaments, or ceremonies; and
trivial airs and songs are successively introduced. Some
can lay no claim to any merit of invention, either in
arrangement of story or incidents, as is exemplified in
a spectacle of this class called Don Quixote, which was
represented in 1733. No fewer than thirty-six characters
figure in this compilation from the master work
of Cervantes, whose spirit is, however, banished from
the composition. The <i>Esopaida ou Vida de Esopo</i>,
(Æsopeid, or Life of Æsop) is one of these pieces which
seems intended to be particularly comic. The first
scene represents a fair at Athens with all its appropriate
accompaniments. The philosopher Zeno appears with
Æsop and two other slaves, all of whom he wishes to
sell. Æsop soon distinguishes himself by coarse jests
and endless quibbling.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> Another philosopher, named
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
Xanthus enters, accompanied by his disciples Periander
and Ennius. He puts Æsop’s wit to the test, and purchases
him.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> The scene now changes. Filena, the daughter
of Xanthus, confides the secrets of her heart to an
old and ugly female slave, named Gerigonza. They are
joined by Euripedes, the wife of the philosopher, who
reprimands her daughter, and sings a silly scolding duet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
with her.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> Æsop enters and again makes a display of
his wit. Then follows a tender scene between Filena
and her lover; Gerigonza becomes enamoured of Æsop;
and the philosopher and his wife quarrel together,
singing a duet of the most vulgar character. By a
succession of scenes of this sort, the action is carried
on through the first act. In the second act King Crœsus
of Lydia arrives with an army to besiege Athens: and
Themistocles appears on horse-back in the suite of
Crœsus. The scene is now alternately in Athens and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
in the camp of Crœsus. Drums and fifes are kept in constant
employment. Splendid pleasure gardens adorned
with statues add to the pomp of the spectacle. But
Æsop, whose puns and quibbles are inexhaustible, is
always the hero of the piece. At last, after bringing
about a peace between Crœsus, and the people of Athens,
he is appointed governor of the city. Thus ends the
Æsopeid, which might with more propriety be entitled the
Buffooniad. Amidst this grotesque jumble, however,
sparks of no common fancy are occasionally elicited; but
the anonymous author seems to have been totally destitute
of literary cultivation, and to have had no higher aim
than to give a humorous colouring to the rudeness of
his combinations. The rest of the Portuguese comic
operas are, upon the whole, still more rude than the
Æsopeid, though some are richer in the musical part of
the composition, and possess grave or even pathetic airs
and duets in the style of the serious Italian opera.</p>

<p>It might, at first sight, be supposed, that a nation
which could be pleased by dramas of this kind, must
be for ever excluded from the path of higher cultivation.
In Lisbon, the Italian opera-house continued to be the
real court theatre. But the Portuguese opera which
stood like a spurious child beside the Italian, maintained
its ground in spite of its parent. Had not the taste for
this kind of dramatic entertainment prevailed down to
the second half of the eighteenth century, a new edition
of the Æsopeid, and other theatrical caricatures, would
not have been published in 1787. The restoration of
a truly noble style in Portuguese poetry, could not
therefore be expected to derive its origin from the
drama.

<h3>RESUMPTION OF AN IMPROVED STYLE IN PORTUGUESE
POETRY.</h3>


<h3 id="Manoel_da_Costa_357">MANOEL DA COSTA.</h3>

<p>To obtain this object, it was, however, only necessary
that a poet should arise, who, charmed by the renewed
union of Portuguese and Italian poetry, might
be induced to place himself under the tutelage of the
early Italian poets. Thus would the Italian opera
have rendered compensation for the evils to which it
had given birth. A Brazilian, named Claudio Manoel da
Costa, was one of the first writers who in this way
contributed to reintroduce an elevated style into Portuguese
poetry.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> Born in the province of Minas Geraes,
that part of Brazil where the chief object is the
working of mines, he seems not to have been destined
for the service of the muses. He indeed passed through
a course of academic studies in Europe; but he himself
states that during the five years which he spent at the
university of Coimbra, no kind of poetry was there held
in esteem, save that which was composed in the corrupt
but fashionable style of the Portuguese Marinists. That
young Da Costa, while at the university of Coimbra,
should have applied himself to the study and imitation
of the older Italian poets, and of Metastasio, was a
circumstance peculiarly favourable to his improvement,
while at the same time it afforded the first proof of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
being destined to arrive at a point of purer cultivation
than his contemporaries. He even ventured on the
composition of Petrarchic sonnets in the Italian language,
and in this attempt he was not unsuccessful. On
his return to Brazil his poetic studies were continued in
the region of gold and diamond treasures, to which he
seems to have attached but little value; for he complains
that amidst these mountains, no Arcadian stream
awakes by its sweet murmur harmonious verse: and that
the turbid waters of the brooks only serve to call to
recollection the rapacious perseverance of the miners by
whose labour they are discoloured. On his own poems he
pronounces a remarkable judgment. He observes that
he was too late in learning the rules of good taste from
the Greeks, Italians and French; and that influenced by
bad example, he sinned against principles, the justice
of which he recognized. The perverted manner of the
sonnetists of the seventeenth century is certainly here
and there perceptible in the writings of Da Costa. But
upon the whole, it may be said, that for nearly the
space of a century, no Portuguese writer had so well
succeeded in that kind of sonnet poetry, which most
charmingly approximates to the style of Petrarch; and
that in the other compositions of this Brazilian poet,
the faults are counterbalanced by merits of the most
pleasing kind. The sonnets included in the collection
of his poetic works, amount to nearly a hundred; and
among them are some in Italian, but none in the
Spanish language. The style of these sonnets, nearly
all of which have love for their subject, is, however,
not altogether that of Petrarch. They possess a certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
tone of poignancy, which betrays the spirit of modern
times. Nevertheless, Da Costa’s style, alike free from
exaggeration and fantastic ornaments, exhibits the
truth of nature and of poetry so happily united with
Petrarchic intensity of feeling, and expressed in language
so elegant and unostentatious, that his sonnets may
justly be numbered among the very best in Portuguese
literature.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> While perusing them, the reader cannot
fail sometimes to fancy that he recognizes the simple
tone of the old Portuguese lyric poetry, reflected by an
Italian echo.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> Though the influence of French taste was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
far less powerful than the Italian with Da Costa, it
still had some effect on his poetry. It appears to have
guided him in the choice of a metre for his <i>epicedios</i>,
or elegies. These poems, however, are not composed
in Alexandrines, but in iambics of five feet, without
any complexity in the rhymes. This is a kind of verse
which is frequently used by English writers; and yet
Da Costa seems never to have turned his attention to
English poetry. But though such verse was quite uncommon,
similar measures had long before been known
in Portugal, and perhaps Da Costa was not the first
Portuguese poet who in this way attempted to approximate
to the French style, as far as the diversity
of the languages would, with propriety, permit the
experiment to be carried. This dull style of rhyming,
appears, however, always somewhat foreign and inharmonious
in Portuguese poetry. In other respects, these
<i>epicedios</i> possess the merit of noble, inartificial, and
pleasing expression; but they want the high charm of
the author’s sonnets, and some of his other poetic
compositions.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> He himself appears to have attached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
most value to his twenty eclogues. They are indeed
written with peculiar care, and are not destitute of
beauty in some of their parts; but, like most Portuguese
eclogues, they are either occasional poems in a bucolic
dress, or partly lyric compositions, which, with the exception
of pastoral names, exhibit no trace of bucolic character.
The extraordinary predilection of the more ancient
Portuguese for this species of pastoral poetry, had therefore
descended from one generation to another, down
to these latter times. One of Da Costa’s eclogues is dedicated
to the prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal,
or as he was then still called, the Count of Oeyras, with
a warmth of feeling which seems to have been the
genuine effusion of the poet’s heart. From an emphatic
eulogy pronounced on that minister, it may be concluded
that the Portuguese poets immediately and sensibly
felt the beneficial effects of his administration, for
the general encouragement of mental freedom was a part
of Pombal’s system. The poet says of the statesman,
that he reconciled innocence with genius, and recalled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
justice to the world.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> Among Da Costa’s other poems,
<span id="His_successful_imitation_362">the most remarkable are his masterly imitations of
canzonettas, cantatas, and other modern Italian poems
for music, to which the opera has given birth</span>. Nothing
finer in this style of poetry is to be found even in the
similar minor works of Metastasio. His <i>A’ Lyra Desprezo</i>
(Farewell to Poetry), and the <i>Palinodia</i>, which
accompanies it, are alone sufficient to prove the perfect
accordance of the Italian and Portuguese language with
respect to the laws of musical poetry.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> But still finer is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
another Farewell, entitled, <i>Fileno ä Nize, despedida</i>,
which was probably composed by Da Costa on his
return to America. Here the old romantic inexhaustibility
in the poetic amplification of a favourite idea,
sustained by a constantly recurring burthen, is united
with all the magic of Metastasio’s versification.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> In
some poems of the same class which Da Costa composed
in the Italian language, a certain degree of constraint is
observable. But his Portuguese cantatas, spiritual as
well as temporal, are not only free from that fault, but
often bear the stamp of excellence.

<h3 id="Progress_of_Portuguese_364">PROGRESS OF PORTUGUESE POETRY IN THE LATTER
PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></h3>

<p>To make a detailed report of Portuguese poetry during
the last thirty years of the eighteenth century, is a task
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
which must be consigned to other writers. In this general
history it is sufficient briefly to describe how the new
spirit of Portuguese literature acquired, even on its
poetic side, a marked influence, though it did not unfold
itself with that energy which was necessary to reproduce
the poetry of the sixteenth century under somewhat
varied features. This period must not yet be extolled
as the commencement of a second golden age of Portuguese
poetry; but the poetic talent of the Portuguese has
opened for itself a wider field; and fantastic rhyming
no longer finds admirers among the educated class of
readers. The Portuguese zealously endeavour to rival,
in polite literature, as well as in science, those nations
who have, or who seem to have outstripped them. But
this rivalry is happily combined with a revived veneration
for the poetry of the sixteenth century. Thus
have the old national forms of Portuguese poetry been
preserved for modern times; and the Portuguese drama
alone seems doomed to be governed by French laws.</p>


<h3 id="Translations_of_latin_365">TRANSLATIONS.</h3>

<p>In the first half of the last thirty years of the
eighteenth century, the desire to cultivate a correct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
style in Portuguese poetry was fostered by new translations
of some of the latin classics. The Odes of
Horace were translated into Portuguese by Joaquim
José da Costa e Sa;<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> the Satyres of Sulpitia by Antonio
Luis de Azavedo;<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> Ovid’s Heroides by Miguel de Couto
Guerreiro;<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> and the comedies of Terence by Leonel da
Costa.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> But it would appear that the Portuguese did
not in their wish to become more intimately acquainted
with genuine poetry, so happily commence the translation
of the Greek poets. On the other hand, several
French and English works obtained a suitable Portuguese
dress. Telemachus appeared in the year 1770;
and Young’s tragedies in 1788. A circumstance which
cannot fail to excite surprize, at least in Germany, is
that in the year 1791 there appeared a Portuguese
translation of the Herman of Baron Shönaich, the most
indifferent of all German epic compositions;<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> but Gessner’s
Death of Abel also appeared in the Portuguese
language in the year 1785.</p>

PERIOD.</h3>

<p>Among the best poems which appeared about this

and Cats, by Joaõ Jorge de Carvalho;<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> and some others.</p>


<h3 id="Garcao_367">GARÇAÕ.</h3>

<p>More particular attention is due to the poetic
works of Pedro Antonio Correa Garçaõ, which were
written at an earlier period, but which were only first
collected and published in the year 1778.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> Since
Ferreira flourished, no other Portuguese poet had so
decidedly formed his taste by the imitation of Horace.
Garçaõ, who for this reason is called the second Portuguese
Horace, did not content himself as Ferreira had
two hundred years before, with imitating in Portuguese
verse, the intellectual elegance and sprightly philosophy of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
Horace’s odes, sermons and epistles; in the composition
of his odes he endeavoured to introduce into Portuguese
poetry verse constructed on the Horatian model.
But, however distinctly the Portuguese language may
without prejudice to its abrupt pronunciation be accentuated,
and however readily it may, at first sight,
seem to accommodate itself to the ancient metres, it is
in reality as little subject to their laws as the Spanish
and Italian; the reason plainly is, that the Portuguese,
like all modern languages, is totally destitute of fixed
syllabic quantity in monosyllabic words; and, that
like the Spanish and Italian languages, it is not sufficiently
rich in dactylic words to afford, in some
degree, the means of concealing this deficiency. In
most of his imitations of ancient verse Garçaõ has
therefore merely strung together, in an unusual way,
lines of long and short iambics. In his sapphic odes,
as he calls them, the sapphic verse is not more obviously
perceptible than in many older compositions of the
same kind, into which rhyme is admitted.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> Garçaõ
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
endeavoured to make an approximation to alcaic verse
by the employment of dactylic words.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> But whatever
objections may be urged against the metrical form of
Garçaõ’s odes, they must be allowed to exhibit in their
spirit and style proofs of a bold endeavour to soar above
the eternal sameness of the sonnet and the eclogue.
Of the spirit of Horatian philosophy, they present no
deeper traces than the odes of Ferreira;<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> but they were
well calculated to recall the Portuguese to the exercise
of a sound and vigorous judgment in poetry. Garçaõ’s
diction is worthy of a poet of the sixteenth century.
Among the lyric works of this poet are a Pindaric ode
with strophes, antistrophes and epodes;<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> and a dythirambic,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
the character of which is certainly somewhat
frigid.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> Had Garçaõ been a pedant, he would not have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
devoted so much labour on sonnets, and on canções and
glosses in the old national forms. He was, however, by
his turn of mind and cultivation better fitted to succeed
in didactic satire and epistles in the manner of Horace;
and in this respect he again resembles Ferreira. But
his satires and epistles, which are among the best in
modern literature, possess more of Horatian gaiety and
airyness than the kindred works of Ferreira;<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> there is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
in their moral tendency occasionally something more
social.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></p>

<p id="His_dramas_372">Garçaõ also endeavoured to give a new direction to
the dramatic poetry of Portugal. He did not possess
sufficient dramatic invention to satisfy a public accustomed
to all the extravagance of operatic and theatric
pomp. But he exerted his utmost efforts to counteract
the influence of that pomp, and of the general
bad taste which seemed to have obtained a complete
dominion over the national theatre. His theory, which
will be further noticed in the next chapter, could only
be promulgated within a narrow circle. As a dramatic
poet, he first declared war against the rude opera taste,
by writing a little comedy in the style of Terence, the
title of which is:&mdash;<i>Theatro Novo, drama</i>, (The New
Theatre, a drama). It is a mere dramatic trifle, with
a very simple plot. An adventurer of fallen fortune
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
conceives the idea of establishing a new theatre, in
which speculation he is to be assisted by his two fair
daughters and a rich Englishman, <i>Arthur Bigodes</i>,
(a name formed from the English oath, “by God.”) He
engages several other individuals in his scheme. Two
love affairs, the one sincere and the other compulsory,
impart comic interest and dramatic unity to the piece.
The principal scene, to which the others merely serve
as auxiliaries, is that in which each member of the
dramatis personæ delivers a critical opinion respecting
the kind of pieces which ought to be represented at
the new theatre. But judicious and patriotic as the
result of the deliberation might be, it was nevertheless
very liable to be interpreted by the public of Lisbon to
the prejudice of a reformer, who consigned the execution
of his plan to a ruined adventurer. This was,
however, the first step towards raising the dignity of
Portuguese comedy, and restoring it to its former rank
as a national drama. The Portuguese public was susceptible
of patriotic sentiments, and Garçaõ understood
how to touch the national feeling without having recourse
to pedantry. Accordingly, he makes the manager
of the new theatre, in a comic situation, say, that his
beloved native country is not a little indebted to him
for the trouble he has taken to rescue her from the
abyss of ignorance in which she lay, miserable and infatuated,
amidst wretched dramas.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> He observes, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
genuine comedy must again become the school of
manners, as it had been to the ancients. In conclusion,
he solemnly invokes the shades of Gil Vicente, Ferreira,
and Saa de Miranda.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> This little comedy is written in
light and agreeable iambic verse, and is not destitute of
dramatic spirit.</p>

<p>Another comedy by Garçaõ appears to have been
intended as an example of the kind of character drama
which the author wished to introduce on the Portuguese stage.
It is called <i>Assemblea ou Partida</i>, (the
Assembly or the Party).<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> This modern Gallo-Portuguese
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
title denotes that the author intended it to be
an elegant conversational piece, affording a picture of
fashionable manners. It is called merely a drama, and
is attributed to no particular species, because it consists
of only one act, which indeed is a tolerably long one.
Thus it is not entirely faithful to the plan of a regular
comedy in the style of Terence. The satire of the
piece is directed against that sort of ostentatious boasting,
to realize which the finances of the fashionable
braggadocio are not always adequate. The characters
are well drawn. To accommodate the national taste in
every way, Garçaõ has introduced into the piece some
well written sonnets, and a half-comic cantata, which
is set to music and performed at the party of a lady.
This comedy exhibits no trace of any particular imitation
of the French style. Garçaõ wished to reform
the Portuguese drama on classic principles, but, as
he himself on another occasion observes, he wished to
effect the reformation with a due regard to modern
times and manners, and consequently without any
rigorous adoption of the ancient dramatic laws in their
full extent.</p>


<h3 id="The_Abbot_Paulino_375">THE ABBOT PAULINO.</h3>

<p>The ingenious prelate, Paulino Cabral de Vasconcellos,
Abbot of Jazente, who is commonly called
merely the Abbot Paulino, deserves to be honourably
distinguished among those Portuguese poets, who at
the latter end of the eighteenth century reclaimed the
national taste, and brought it under the rules of classic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
cultivation.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> The collection of his poems, printed in
the year 1786, consists of sonnets only; but without
having read them, it is scarcely possible to conceive
that this species of poetic composition should have
acquired so many new charms towards the close of the
eighteenth century. In this collection of two hundred
and forty-five sonnets, which are probably selected from
a still greater number of compositions of the same kind
by the Abbot Paulino, there is scarcely one that can
be pronounced dull or heavy; most of them display a
peculiar union of clearness, lightness and elegance, with
a tone of Horatian philosophy and irony. The study
of French literature seems to have contributed to the
singular cultivation of the Abbot Paulino. But the
spirit of his poetry is by no means French. In one
poetic glance he comprehended the various situations
of real life, viewing them sometimes on the romantic,
sometimes on the rural, and sometimes on the comic
side; and the pictures of sentiment and reflection
which he thus calls up, are compressed into the sonnet
form in the most pleasing and natural manner. The
best of Paulino’s sonnets are those which are conceived
in a tone of elegant satire;<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> and some which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
though apparently frivolous, occasionally remind the
reader of Propertius.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> The satire of this Portuguese
poet, however, very seldom degenerates into grossness.</p>


<h3 id="Dona_Catharina_de_Sousa_377">DONA CATHARINA DE SOUSA&mdash;HER TRAGEDY OF
OSMIA.</h3>

<p>But dramatic poetry in Portugal required some
particular excitement to make it keep pace with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
new cultivation of the nation; and an impulse of this
kind was given when the Lisbon academy of sciences,
which, during the last twenty years of the eighteenth
century, was constantly embracing new objects, turned
its attention to polite literature. The academy offered
a prize for the best tragedy in the Portuguese language.
Competitors came eagerly forward. But none of the
tragedies which have been crowned by the academy,
obtained so much popularity as the <i>Osmîa</i> of Dona
Catharina de Sousa.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> It is probable that no other
female writer who has acquired celebrity in the
eighteenth century, could have produced such a work,
though, perhaps, in other respects she might rank
higher as a poetess than Catharina de Sousa. The
fable of the tragedy, according to the conditions required
by the academy, in the year 1785, is selected
from the Portuguese national history. Three tragedies
were produced within the space of three years. In the
year 1788 the academy awarded the prize to <i>Osmîa</i>;
and on opening the sealed note, in which the author’s
name was supposed to be inscribed, it was found to
contain only a reference to a prize question respecting
improvements in the cultivation of the olive in Portugal,
with a request that the academy would apply to
that object the prize which was renounced for the
tragedy of Osmia. But the equally generous and ingenious
authoress soon became known. The tragedy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
was first printed without her name; but a second
edition was published in the year 1795. It owes its
celebrity not merely from the circumstance of its being
the production of a female pen. In several scenes of
this drama, tragic pathos is, in the happiest way, combined
with an elegance which from the sex of the
writer was more to be expected than the former
quality. The subject is chosen from the history of the
ancient inhabitants of Portugal, rather than of the Portuguese.
A story from the age of romance would have
better fulfilled the idea of a national tragedy; but
Dona Catharina de Sousa, in the spirit of modern
cosmopolite education, in a great measure formed by
French reading, followed the Gallic taste even in a predilection
for the Roman age in tragic drama. Osmia,
the heroine of the tragedy, is a Lusitanian Princess of
the race of the Turdetani, who in the second century
of the Christian era, sought to emancipate themselves
from the Roman yoke. She is, contrary to her inclination,
united to Prince Rindacus, who heads the Turdetani
in their insurrection against the Romans. Osmia
combats like a heroine. The Turdetani are, however,
defeated; Rindacus disappears, and Osmia is made prisoner
by the Romans. The Roman Prætor Lælius
becomes deeply enamoured of the fair captive, and she
in her turn is not indifferent to his passion. With the
principal persons thus situated the developement of the
dramatic action commences. The composition would
doubtless have been much more rich and brilliant if the
authoress had not so rigorously confined herself within
the rules of French tragedy. The Roman characters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
appear modernized in the French style. In this very
absurd way the Prætor Lælius is drawn. On several
occasions he complains of his “poor heart” in as doleful
a strain as a hapless lover of modern times. But in
the delicate representation of the relationship of Osmia
with the Prætor, and with her rude barbarian husband,
the sentiments of a noble-minded woman are painted
in such a manner as none but a woman could paint
them. The tragic grandeur of the composition rests on
the character of Osmia, who will not on any consideration
render herself unworthy of her noble descent.
The loftiest pride of patriotism contends in her bosom
with love for the Roman Prætor, whom she wishes
to hate, but whose tender generosity she feels less and
less power to resist.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> The feminine heroism of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
character thus acquires a pensive gentleness, which
renders her, as a woman, more and more interesting
in every scene. The character of Osmia is forcibly
relieved by contrast. A Turdetanian prophetess, who
is also among the number of the captives, burns with
national pride and hatred of the Romans; and her
energetic but unfeminine patriotism is the means of
constantly producing tragic concussions in the train of
the events, until the husband of Osmia unexpectedly
re-appears. The authoress has been eminently successful
in the gradual heightening of the tragic interest.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a>
She did not venture to shed blood on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
stage. The death of Osmia is related; but at the end
her husband enters wounded and dying. Notwithstanding
the simplicity of the composition, the tragedy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
comprises a considerable share of action. The rapid
flow of the dialogue in some of the scenes, approximates
more nearly to the tragic style of Voltaire, than
to that of Corneille and Racine. The language is dignified
throughout; though in some scenes it is deficient
in poetic keeping. But according to the rule which the
authoress herself was accustomed to consider as the
only correct one in the estimation of dramatic perfection,
she could not avoid faults which she theoretically
regarded as beauties. The present is not the
proper place for analysing the individual fine passages
of this tragedy. The feminine character of the whole
composition, however, well merits a minute analysis in
a theory of poetry.</p>


<h3 id="Failure_of_Osmia_383">FAILURE OF OSMIA ON THE STAGE&mdash;PREVALENCE
OF DRAMATIC IMITATIONS AND TRANSLATIONS.</h3>

<p>The great difference between such a tragedy as
Osmia and the dramatic entertainments to which the
Portuguese public were accustomed, must have impeded
the good effect which under other circumstances
might have been produced by the prizes which the
academy of Lisbon continued to offer. Osmia was
performed; but it did not obtain a favourable reception
from the public, and some similar tragedies by which it
was succeeded experienced nearly the same fate. The
Italian opera maintained its consideration in Lisbon;
and the dramas which have since been produced on the
Portuguese stage, are for the most part, either imitations
of foreign pieces or translations. No modern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
Portuguese poet seems to have attempted to pursue
the path of dramatic composition in the style of the
Spanish comedy, and to carry it forward from the
point at which Gil Vicente had stopped. Of the modern
Portuguese comedies in the French style those from the
pen of Guita have the highest reputation. But the
Portuguese appear still to cherish as a favourite
dramatic entertainment, the burlesque and truly national
<i>entremeses</i> (interludes) which have either risen
out of the Spanish compositions of the same class, or
have with them one common origin.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></p>

AND RHETORIC, DURING THIS PERIOD.</span></h2>


<h3 id="Further_decline_of_Portuguese_eloquence_387"><i>Further Decline of Portuguese Eloquence.</i></h3>

<p>Before it was possible for any thing like true eloquence
to find a place in Portuguese literature, public
spirit had to revive from that state of feebleness and
apathy into which it had been plunged by the rapid
decline of Portugal from the pinnacle of national
glory. It was indispensable that a time should return
in which the human mind might move with somewhat
more freedom in the trammels of ecclesiastical tyranny.
The nation had to become once more capable of contemplating
great objects. The national taste was to be
reclaimed from the affectation of pompous phraseology,
and it was necessary that the spirit of philosophy should
be allowed to make suitable approaches towards the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
spirit of poetry. But these, and all the other conditions
requisite for the revival of polite prose in Portugal,
were never more decidedly wanting than precisely at
the period when the introduction of French manners
seemed likely to infuse a French taste into the national
literature. But reckoning from the latter end of the
seventeenth century, the imitation of French taste
had operated for a considerable time, and yet had
influenced only the forms of social life. Its presence
in Portuguese literature, was scarcely perceptible.
It has already been shewn that during the first half
of the eighteenth century, Portuguese poetry, even in
the hands of the few poets who were not unwilling
to learn elegance from the French, continued subject
to the style of the Gongorists and Marinists. Of
course still less was it to be expected that Portuguese
writers should be capable of imitating the polite prose
of the French, since such an imitation would pre-suppose
a cultivation of the understanding which at that
time was not practicable in Portugal. The French
taste in so far as it really found admission into Portugal,
doubtless contributed at first, as about the same
time its adoption did in Germany, to repress the loftier
style of eloquence, for the language became so corrupted
by foreign words and phrases, that it was
difficult for the prose writer to know what tract it was
proper to follow. The poet might, if he pleased, still
adhere to the style of the sixteenth century; for his
language was not like that of prose composition, subject
to the laws of fashion. But no author could attempt
classic prose, in the language of the sixteenth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
century, without encountering the risk of being regarded
as a pedant by his contemporaries; and if he
wished to follow the fashion, he was obliged to disfigure
the language in which he wrote.</p>

<p>A few works of research which were written during
the first half of the eighteenth century, are, with the
exception of books of devotion, almost the only compositions
which still preserved a kind of national prose
style in Portuguese literature. Barbosa Machado’s
great national Dictionary of Learned Men, is not
written without rhetorical care. The author wished
to express himself with correctness and elegance, particularly
where he uses the language of panegyric,
but even then he could not avoid frigid and pompous
phraseology; and some phrases, which he seems to have
admired, are constantly recurring in the work; as for
example when he calls a poet “one of the most melodious
swans of the Portuguese Parnassus,” without considering
that Parnassus is neither a river nor a pond.
A few affected metaphors were the only recognized
beauties of prose composition at this period in Portugal.
Didactic prose could no longer exist when the philosophic
and scientific cultivation of the Portuguese became
daily more abridged, and was almost limited to
the small remnant which was taught in the cloisters
and the colleges of the Jesuits. The lectures which
under these circumstances were delivered in the academies,
were considered to have sufficiently fulfilled their
objects if they did not lull the auditors to sleep. The
art of historical composition was now completely extinguished
in Portugal.

<h3 id="New_cultivation_of_eloquence_390">NEW CULTIVATION OF ELOQUENCE&mdash;CLASSICAL
PROSE AUTHORS STILL WANTING IN MODERN
PORTUGUESE LITERATURE.</h3>

<p>In the second half, and more especially during the
last thirty years of the eighteenth century, the spirit of
improvement was awakened, and began to diffuse itself
into every department of Portuguese eloquence. The
admirable clearness, precision and facility of the French
prose, has at length exercised an advantageous influence
on the Portuguese. Without enforcing with
pedantic rigour the restoration of all the old forms of
the sixteenth century, the best Portuguese authors now
endeavour to write their mother tongue with purity,
and at the same time to satisfy the new wants created
by the progress of time and the spirit of the age. The
praiseworthy diligence which the Portuguese now manifest
in collecting scientific knowledge of every kind, and
in republishing the works of their early authors, appears,
however, to have operated indirectly to the prejudice of
eloquence, for among the men of talent, to whom Portugal
is indebted for her regeneration, none have yet
distinguished themselves in prose composition. But the
Portuguese have had so many things to retrieve, that
they have scarcely had time to devote particular attention
to the rhetorical form of didactic works. An effort
to avoid the bad taste of the preceding age, and upon
the whole to cultivate a clear and dignified form of expression,
is perceptible in most of the modern treatises
of the Portuguese. Empty bombast has given place to
the language of reason. The Portuguese nation have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
now to wish for a modern historian qualified to tread in
the footsteps of Barros, Brito and Andrada. Such a
writer might succeed in still more firmly rivetting the
connecting link between the promising present and
glorious past in the hearts of Portuguese patriots.</p>


<h3 id="Romantic_prose_translations_391">ROMANTIC PROSE&mdash;TRANSLATIONS.</h3>

<p>A new era of romantic prose might also have been
commenced in Portugal, had the poetic spirit of the old
Portuguese pastoral romances been modified, instead of
being enfeebled by the introduction of the cultivated
forms of modern prose. Translations of foreign novels
seem to have too readily satisfied that portion of the
Portuguese public, whose cultivation was, through this
species of reading, gradually approximating to the taste
of the other nations of Europe. A translation from
the French of Le Sage’s popular Gil Blas was supplied
by the poet Barbosa Du Boccage, who is probably descended
from a French family. This was soon followed
by translations of the Moral Tales of D’Arnaud, and of
various works of a similar description.</p>


<h3 id="Portuguese_criticism_of_the_eighteenth_century">PORTUGUESE CRITICISM OF THE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY.</h3>

<p>The progress of genuine prose in Portuguese literature
during the eighteenth century, may, upon the
whole, be estimated by the style of Portuguese criticism
in the same period. It may be presumed that the
authors of critical treatises on literary subjects, endeavoured
by their own prose to shew the relationship,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
which, according to their opinion, ought to exist between
poetry and eloquence; and it is certain that the principles
on which they wrote precisely corresponded with
the rhetorical cultivation of the age, within the boundaries
of Portuguese taste. These theoretical labours,
in their relation to Portuguese poetry and eloquence,
deserve to be particularly noticed.</p>


<h3 id="Ericeyras_introduction_392">ERICEYRA’S INTRODUCTION TO HIS HENRIQUEIDA.</h3>

<p>A new epoch in Portuguese criticism seems to commence
with the critical treatises of the Count da Ericeyra;
for this writer studiously availed himself of the
principles of French criticism, and his authority gave
full effect to the example he set. But there was more
of semblance than reality in Ericeyra’s appropriation of
French criticism. He had too little feeling for the
essence of poetry to be able to modify the idea of
beauty according to French principles of correctness,
without losing sight of the true foundation of that idea.
With all his critical rules, therefore, he never rose
above what may be termed the external apparatus of
poetry. Within that apparatus his taste was altogether
circumscribed. His general opinions on poetry are
developed with sufficient clearness in the copious introduction
to his <i>Henriqueida</i>,<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> and in the explanatory
notes which he has attached to that epic composition.
The introductory dissertation is written in good prose;
but the observations which the author makes on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
subject of epic poetry, partake more of prosaic than
of poetic views. The subject with which the Count
da Ericeyra’s critical essay commences is imitation; but,
composing in the spirit of his own system, he first
speaks of the celebrated poets whose works he had
imitated, and afterwards of the imitation of nature.
He speaks of Homer with emphasis; and yet at the
same time acknowledges that he was acquainted with
that poet only through Madame Dacier’s prose translation.
Under these circumstances he reasonably enough
speaks with still greater emphasis of Virgil, whose
works he could read in the original. Of all human
works, Virgil’s Æneid, in the opinion of Ericeyra,
approaches nearest to perfection.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> On the other hand,
he says, that Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso, belongs more
properly to the class of romantic tales of chivalry,
than to epic poetry; but that it is nevertheless worthy
of imitation on account of its pleasing narrative style
and the “fertility of poetic genius,” which the Count
acknowledges Ariosto to possess. Voltaire’s Henriade,
however, which was then the newest epic production,
is pronounced to be particularly distinguished for its
“elevated and natural poetry.” Ericeyra takes this
opportunity of more accurately defining his theory of
perfection in epic poetry. It belongs, in his opinion, to a
perfect epic action, that the hero of the poem should as
much as possible be kept present in the scene of action.
On epic machinery Ericeyra pronounces nearly the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
judgment as Boileau, namely, that when a modern introduces
into his poetry the Christian system of the
ancient mythology, the pleasure to be derived from
epic composition is destroyed. Even the Jerusalem
Delivered, would be a tedious work, had not Tasso
enlivened the “pious melancholy of the subject” by the
introduction of magic and by other means. The example
set by Camoens, who introduced into modern poetry
all the mythological deities as allegorical characters, is
recommended as highly worthy of imitation; but nevertheless
Tasso’s plan is not to be altogether condemned.
Ericeyra makes some very judicious observations on the
epic treatment of real history. Lucan, he says, was
the first who disfigured epic poetry by writing merely
as a poetic historian; and he attributes the ill success
of the Spaniards in epic poetry to their having always
preferred Lucan to every other model. His remarks
on the epic character are no less correct; and his opinions
on language and style are such as might be
expected from a man of sound and cultivated understanding.
He praises the dramatic style of Corneille,
Racine and Moliere. From these authors, he observes,
a writer may learn how to express naturally the heroic
and tender passions in their full force, and without the
false glare which disfigures the works of many modern
and also some ancient poets. Thus the Count da Ericeyra
endeavoured to vindicate his own poem before the
tribunal of the public. The most remarkable circumstance
with respect to the whole treatise is the little
value which the author attaches to poetic allegory.
When it is recollected in what esteem allegory was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
held by the early Portuguese critics, Ericeyra’s treatise,
though in other respects unimportant, and only interesting
in its connection with the whole of Portuguese
literature, will be recognised as at least a step gained
in literary criticism.</p>


<h3 id="Garcaos_lectures_395">GARÇAÕ’S LECTURES.</h3>

<p>Among the treatises of criticism by which it was
hoped, about the middle of the eighteenth century to
reform the taste of the Portuguese, some consideration
is due to those written by Garçaõ, the imitator of Horace.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a>
They are in the form of lectures, and were
delivered in an assembly called the academy of the
Portuguese Arcadians. On this account they are also
entitled to rank among works of oratory. In two of
these lectures, Garçaõ zealously defends the Aristotelian
theory of tragedy in its application to the modern drama.
He insists on obedience to the rule of not shedding blood
on the stage. Accordingly he commends the French
drama; and notices Addison’s Cato with approbation.
His opinion, on this point, he conceives is sufficiently
supported by these two remarks&mdash;1st. That to fulfil the
object of tragic art it is not necessary to shed blood on
the stage&mdash;and 2dly. That it is improper, because at an
intellectual entertainment disgusting objects should not
be presented to the eye. Garçaõ appears also to have
understood in the usual way the condition of Aristotle,
that tragedy should refine the passions of the spectator.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
He expatiates much on the moral utility of a perfect tragedy,
through which the theatre might, in his opinion,
be easily converted into an excellent school of morals.
To this effect the opinions of the French critics Le
Bossu and Dacier, are industriously cited in concert
with those of Aristotle. Both lectures were given in
the year 1757. The main object of a third lecture
which Garçaõ delivered to the same society in the
same year, is to demonstrate that the imitation of the
classic poets of antiquity is one of the most essential
requisites of modern poetry. He observes that the judicious
and the servile imitator must not be confounded
together, for that the latter is in fact merely a plagiarist.
Garçaõ himself seems, however, to have been somewhat
puzzled to make out this distinction; for he asserts that
Camoens has in his pastoral poems imitated Virgil in
the same manner as Virgil has Theocritus. A skilful
imitator, he says, may excel the poet whom he imitates,
as Horace has in many passages excelled Pindar. At
the same time it must be allowed, that these and the
following lectures of Garçaõ possess the merit of pure,
natural, and dignified language; and that in several
passages they display true eloquence.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> Garçaõ, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
felt a patriotic interest in the improvement of the polite
literature of his country, expected that the academy
of the Portuguese Arcadians would by its exertions
revive the good taste of the sixteenth century. Only
such a society, zealously competing for the welfare and
honour of the country, can, he says, become “the
Alexander who will cut this gordian knot of bad taste,
the Achilles who will conquer this Troy.”<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> But it appears
that he appealed to his Arcadians in vain. Their
literary patriotism was of a very passive character;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
and the advantages which Garçaõ hoped this society
would procure, were destined to be obtained through
another.</p>


<h3 id="Philological_and_critical_treatises_398">PHILOLOGICAL AND CRITICAL TREATISES OF THE
ACADEMICIANS JOAQUIM DE FOYOS&mdash;FRANCISCO
DIAS&mdash;ANTONIO DAS NAVES, &amp;C.</h3>

<p>Among the literary treatises (<i>Memorias de Litteratura</i>)
published by the Royal Academy of Sciences in
Lisbon,<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> are to be found the latest contributions to
Portuguese criticism and eloquence; and that society
may justly boast of the well directed efforts of its members
to promote the literary cultivation of the nation.
At the head of these literary treatises, there appeared
in the year 1792 a remarkable essay on Portuguese
pastoral poetry by Joaquim de Foyos.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> This treatise
served at once to record the unconquerable predilection
with which the Portuguese adhered to their pastoral
poetry, and the new freedom of opinion which
ventured to shew itself in opposition to the oracles of
French criticism. Joaquim de Foyos asserts, that pastoral
poetry must be the oldest, and consequently the
most natural and original style of poetry. In the history
of human nature, he observes, the shepherd’s life
is in the natural course of the transition from barbarism
to social cultivation. It is, he adds, precisely in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
stage of the developement of human wants and energies,
that the mind is particularly awakened to poetic
activity: and as in pastoral life man is surrounded by
the sweetest tranquillity of nature, so must pastoral
poetry be the true poetry of nature. Joaquim de Foyos
has indeed related consistently with his own notions,
the history of mankind and poetry in a way which is
well calculated to set forth the particular merits of bucolic
composition: otherwise history might soon have
convinced him that pastoral life has scarcely ever been
the passage from the savage state to civilization: that
the kind of pastoral state which favours the ground
work of bucolic poetry, has only arisen under particular
circumstances in a few places; and has, even there been
of little advantage to poetry: that Greek poetry no
more originated in Arcadia, than German in Switzerland:
that the oldest Greek poetry exhibits no trace of
the pastoral character: that Theocritus first devoted
himself to this style of composition at the voluptuous
court of the Ptolemies in Alexandria: and that its
revival in the romantic age, like its birth in Alexandria,
presupposes a degree of social cultivation, whence the
human mind longingly reverts to a more natural existence,
on which it at last bestows ideal beauties. Joaquim
de Foyos judges of the French critics by more
just principles. He observes, that these critics, of whom
Le Bossu may be placed at the head, deduce numerous
chimerical rules from what they term the morality of a
poem. Dacier, he says, has also misunderstood Aristotle
in wishing to render the story of a poem a sort of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
Æsopic fable. The ingenious and elegant Marmontel
has fallen into the same error.</p>

<p>A philological treatise in the form of a dictionary,
by Antonio Pereita do Figueiredo, on the genius of the
Portuguese language, according to the Decades of Barros,<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a>
though not immediately connected with poetry
and rhetoric, is nevertheless worthy of honourable notice,
since it is calculated to direct Portuguese writers
to the study of Barros, and the spirit of their mother
tongue. Another treatise by the same writer, has for
its object to recommend Barros as a model for Portuguese
eloquence.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></p>

<p>The analysis of the poetic language and style of
Saa de Miranda, Ferreira, Bernardes, Caminha and
Camoens, by Francisco Dias, is more useful than most
of the treatises of the same kind previously written in
Portuguese.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> The investigations of this intelligent
writer are philological rather than critical; but the
critical observations which he introduces are dictated
by a clear judgment and just feeling. The improvements
which Saa de Miranda effected in the poetic language
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
of the Portuguese are here exhibited in their true light.
Even the latinisms of Ferreira are placed in an advantageous
point of view by the author. He speaks of
Camoens in terms of enthusiasm; but in the encomiums
which have lately been bestowed on Caminha, Dias does
not concur.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> The treatise is, upon the whole, very well
written.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a></p>

<p>An Essay by Antonio das Naves Pereira on the
proper use of the language of the Portuguese writers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>

judicious critical remarks.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> It is written expressly
to condemn the gallicizing (<i>a Francezia</i>) of modern
Portuguese. This learned philologist and critic is

style of poetry.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></p>

<p id="Compendium_of_rhetoric_402">The want of a work which might in the strict sense

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h2>


<h3 id="Comparison_of_Portuguese_and_Spanish_literature_403">COMPARISON OF PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH LITERATURE.</h3>

<p>On a general comparison of the treasures of the polite
learning of Spain with the poetry and eloquence of Portugal,
there will appear on the Spanish side a balance of
literary riches, but not of genius and cultivation. The
heroic romances, the satire of Cervantes, and the dramatic
poetry of the Spaniards, still preponderate, though
the epic poem of Camoens, and all the beautiful and
singular productions of Portuguese pastoral poetry be
weighed in the opposite scale. The greater number of
the old Portuguese lyric poets, does not, as to intrinsic
value, raise the Portuguese lyric poetry above the
Spanish. The dramatic works of Gil Vicente, which
are completely thrown into shade by those of Lope de
Vega and Calderon, would still be eclipsed, did they
even possess the riper cultivation of the few dramas
of Saa da Miranda, Ferreira, and Vasconcellos; which,
however, is again more than counterbalanced by the
dramatic energy and lofty poetry of the works of
Moreto, Antonio de Solis, and other Spanish authors.
But in a general view of the poetic genius of both nations,
it would be wrong to overlook the different
extent of the territories to which the two languages
belong, or to forget that in the style of romantic pastoral
poetry, which shines so brilliantly in Spanish
literature, the Portuguese instructed the Spaniards, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
never were excelled by them. Generally speaking it
may be said, that in no earnest literary competition
between the Portuguese and the Spaniards, have the
former ever suffered themselves to be outdone by the
latter. Accidental circumstances, not want of energy,
prevented the Portuguese from keeping pace with the
Spaniards in dramatic poetry; and under these circumstances
no serious competition could arise. In the
cultivation of modern eloquence both nations have at
last advanced to nearly the same degree of improvement.</p>

<p>Portuguese poetry is no less national than the Spanish.
The tendency to orientalism, with which the
Spaniards have been so frequently reproached, was, in
like manner, a characteristic of the poetic genius of
the Portuguese, until the general influence of French
taste produced a remarkable change in manners and
in literature. To form a just estimate of the works of
Saa de Miranda, Camoens, Rodriguez Lobo, and the
other principal Portuguese poets, it is not the Greek
or Latin, and by no means the French rule of criticism,
which ought to be made the measure of poetic
excellence. From a right understanding of what really
constitutes natural and ideal poetry, is derived the
only true principle whereby the judgment ought here
to be guided in forming its decision. Keeping this
principle in view, attention must be paid to local circumstances,
which, whenever ancient or modern poetry
has arisen out of the poetic perception of nature and
human life, rather than out of reading, or philosophic
and critical abstractions, give to the poetic creations of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
the mind the true impress of reality;&mdash;and, amidst realities,
the poets of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
lived. These poets sufficiently satisfied their contemporaries
and their age, but they had no wish to recommend
themselves to posterity by a theoretically cultivated
and universal style of poetry. Their poetic world is,
accordingly, something more than a mere imaginary
world; and what they only wrote to please themselves
and their contemporaries, must increase in value with
every succeeding century; because the circumstances
under which such a style of poetry could arise, are
gradually becoming more and more rare.</p>

The Portuguese of former times never resigned the common
denomination of Spaniards to the inhabitants of the Castilian
monarchy. They invariably styled the Spaniards <i>Castelhanos</i>. Even
in the late edition of the poems of Camões, that writer, who composed
only a few trifles in Castilian verse, is distinguished by the
title of <i>Principe dos Poetas de Hespanha</i>, (Prince of Spanish poets).</p></div>

The changes which the name Alphonso undergoes in Spanish
and Portuguese may mislead persons who are not intimate with those
languages. In Spanish it is indiscriminately either <i>Alfonso</i> or
<i>Alonzo</i>; the latter form, however, is chiefly used in common life. In
Portuguese, from the natural tendency of that language to omit the
letter <i>l</i>, the name is invariably pronounced and written <i>Affonso</i>.</p></div>

The <i>Cronica do Condestabre de Portugal Nun Alvarez
Pereyra</i>, printed in gothic letters at Lisbon 1526, in folio, may
serve for an example. That this chronicle was composed about the
end of the fourteenth century is a fact which admits of no doubt.
Though written quite in the dry style of the chronicles, yet the
author seems to have had a vague idea of historical arrangement;
and he sometimes aims at a certain degree of skill and eloquence in
antithesis. Thus in the preface, which commences in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>Antigamente foy costume fazerem memoria das cousas que se
faziam, assi erradas, como dos valentes e nobres feitos; dos erros,
porque dellos soubessem guardar, e dos valentes e nobres feitos, aos
boõs fizessem cobiça a ver peras cousas semelhantes fazerem.</p>

<p>With this artificial commencement, the simplicity of the following
passage forms a remarkable contrast:&mdash;</p>

<p>E por nom fazer longo prollego (<i>prologo</i>), farei aqui começo
em este virtuoso Senhor, do qual veo o valente y muy virtuoso conde
estabre Dom Nunalvaréz Pereyra. E assi dehi em diante siguiremos
nossa historia.</p></div>

Dieze, in his Remarks on Velasquez p. 105, has printed a

According to the testimony of Barbosa Machado, Lopes
wrote several chronicles; only one was however printed, a damaged
copy of which I have now before me. It is entitled: <i>Chronica
d’El Rey D. Joaõ I. de boa memoria &amp;c. composta por Fernam
Lopes. Lisboa 1644</i>. With Zurrara’s continuation it forms one
thick folio volume. It is singular enough that in these old Portuguese
chronicles, the word <i>Rey</i> (King) is always preceded by
the Castilian article <i>El</i>, instead of the Portuguese <i>O</i>. Thus
<i>El Rey</i>, united as if forming one word, has become in the official
stile of Portugal the substitute for <i>O Rey</i>.</p></div>

The following speech, which is short, and is not badly conceived,
may be transcribed here entire as an interesting specimen
of Portuguese prose of the fifteenth century. Nuno Alvarez, who
commands the Portuguese army against the Castilians, whom his
brothers have joined, thus addresses his companions in arms:&mdash;</p>

<p>Amigos, eu nam sey mais que diga do que vos jà tenho
dito, però ainda vos quero responder a ìsso, que me dissestes.
Quanto he o que dizeis: que os Castellanos sam muytos, et vem
grandes Capitanes, et senhores com elles, tanto vos serà mayor
honra, et louvor de serem por vós vencidos, ca jà muytas vezes
aconteceo os poucos vencerem muytos, porque todo o vencimento
he em Deos, et nam nos homens. Na outra cousa, em
que duvidaes, segundo parece, que he a vinda de meus Irmaõs em
sua companhia, a ìsso nam temais por nenhuma guisa, nem Deos
quizesse tal, que nenhum por mim fosse enganado. Ca eu naõ os
hey por meus Irmanos nesta parte, pois que vem por desviar a terra,
que os gérou. E nam digo contra meus Irmaõs, mas em verdade
vos juro, que ainda que ahi viesse meu Padre, eu seria contra elle,
por serviço do Mestre meu senhor. E pera vós verdes que he assim,
se a voz praz de em esta obra sermos todos companheiros; eu vos
juro, et prometo, que eu seja o dianteiro ante a minha bandeira, et
o primeiro que comece a pelejar, et assi podeis ver a vontade, que

The Spaniards cannot easily enter into the spirit of these
verbal allusions in the Portuguese language; for the word which in
Portuguese signifies a <i>river</i>, is in Spanish by the usual change in
the penult syllable <i>Ribera</i>, and signifies a <i>bank</i>. The Portuguese
<i>Ribeira</i>, or <i>Ribeiro</i>, is probably derived from <i>Rivus</i>; and the
Spanish <i>Ribera</i> from <i>Ripa</i>.</p></div>

The new edition of the <i>Menina e Moça, ou Saudades de
Bernardim Ribeyro</i>, published by one of the descendants of the
poet, <i>Lisboa</i> 1785, in 8vo. is easier to read than the old edition, on
account of the more regular punctuation. But the old and scarce
edition, which, however, bears on the title page, the words <i>de novo
estampada, Lisboa</i> 1559, in 8vo. contains, in an appendix, Ribeyro’s
eclogues, and also a collection of old Portuguese poems by other
authors.</p></div>

She says:&mdash;</p>

<p>Escolhi para meu contentamento (se entre tristezas et saudades
ha algum) virme viver a este monte, onde o lugar et mingoa da conversação
da gente te fosse, como para meu cuidado cumpria: porque
grande erro fora depois de tantos nojos, quantos eu com estes meus
olhos, vi aventurarme ainda esperar do mundo o descanço, que elle
nunca dè a ninguem. Estando eu aqui ló, taõ longe dè toda a outra
gente, et de mim ainda mais longe; donde nam vejo senaõ serras de
hum cabo, que se naõ mudaõ nunca, et do outro aguas do mar, que
nunca estam quedas, onde cuidava eu jà que esquecia a desaventura,
porque ella, et depois eu a todo poder que ambas pudemos naõ
leixamos em mi nada em que pudesse nova magoa ter lugar; &amp;c.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="label">42</a>
The following is the passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>Nam tardou muito que estando eu assi cuidando, sobre hum verde
ramo que por sima da agua se estendia, se veyo pousar hum Rousinol,
começou a cantar tam docemente que de todo me levou a pos si o
meu sentido d’ouvir; et elle cada vez crecia mais em seus queixumes,
que parecia que como cansada queria acabar, senaõ quando tornava
como que começava. Entam (triste da avezinha) que estandose
assi queixando nam sey como se cahio morte sobre aquella agua,
cahindo por entre as ramas, muitas folhas cahiram tambem com ella;
pareceo aquello sinal de pezar naquelle arvoredo de caso tam desestrado.
Levava a pos si a agua, et as folhas a pos ella, et quizeraa
eu hir tomar: mas polla corrente que alli fazia, et pelo mato que
dali para baxo acerca do rio logo estava, prestasmente se alongou
da vista; o coraçaõ me doco tanto entaõ em ver taõ asinha morto
quem dantes taõ pouco havia que vira estar cantando, que naõ pude
ter as lagrimas.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">43</a>
This passage may be regarded as a specimen of romantic
didactic prose:&mdash;</p>

<p>Coitadas das mulheres que porque vem que as namoram os
homens com obras cuidam que assi se devem elles tambem de
namorar: et he muito pelo contrario, que aos homens namoramnos
desdeis et presunçoens, apos huma brandura de olhos, asperesa muita
de obras. Isto de seu natural lhes deve vir, porque sam rijos, que
parece nam terem em muito senam o que trabalham muito. Nos
outras boandas de nosso nacimento fazemos outra cousa: porem se
elles com nosco entrassem a juizo, que razam mostrariam per si?
Ca o amor que he senam vontade? Ella nam se dà, nem se toma por
força, mas como quer que seja, ou pela desventura das mulheres, ou
pela ventura dos homens.</p></div>

<i>na</i>, instead of <i>en lo</i> and <i>en la</i>, must necessarily be offensive to the
Spanish ear. It is singular, however, that the Portuguese language
has a tendency to lengthen those particular words in which the
Spanish cannot tolerate any further extension; for the Spanish
<i>Universidad</i>, <i>Magestad</i>, &amp;c. become in Portuguese <i>Universidade</i>,
<i>Magestade</i>, and so forth.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="label">57</a>
It deserves, however, to be noticed, that of all the sister languages
of Roman descent, the Portuguese alone has preserved, in
its grammatical structure, a remarkable fragment of the ancient
latin conjugation, namely, the pluperfect of the indicative, viz.
<i>fora</i>, <i>foras</i>, <i>fora</i>, from <i>fueram</i>, <i>fueras</i>, <i>fuerat</i>. But this pluperfect
has also the signification of a preterite of the subjunctive; and
through the ambiguity, which thus arises, the value of this grammatical
relic in the Portuguese language is in a great measure lost, notwithstanding
that the connection may easily mark the proper sense.
But how happens it that of all the languages claiming a Roman
origin, the Portuguese, though in other respects remarkable for a
certain simplicity of character, is, upon the whole, distinguished by
the most numerous and subtle tenses in the conjugations of its verbs?</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58" class="label">58</a>
This trait of distinction between the Portuguese and Spanish
national character is still noticed by travellers. The Portuguese is
a bigot, like the Spaniard, but he is far less fanatical. The intercourse
of trade in Lisbon, requires an external appearance of tolerance.
If the English sailors refuse to take off their hats during
the catholic processions in Portugal, the populace content themselves
with exclaiming, “they are English heretics!” or uttering
some other words of reproach.</p></div>

From the new edition of the works of Saa de Miranda, which
has already been mentioned, it appears that the Portuguese still
appreciate the merits of this poet, or rather that his writings have
again been restored to favour. But in this new edition the punctuation
is as faulty as in Portuguese books of older date; and thus the
foreigner experiences additional difficulty in studying a poet whose
works, even if correctly printed, would not be very easily understood.</p></div>

Nicolas Antonio and Barbosa Machado are the authorities for
the particulars here collected. Dieze has likewise quoted from the
above-mentioned writers, the account given in his appendix to
Velasquez, p. 86, respecting Gil Vicente, and Paula Vicente, the
daughter of the poet.</p></div>

The library of the University of Göttingen contains a copy
of this old edition, entitled:&mdash;</p>

<p>Compliaçam de todalas obras de <i>Gil Vicente</i> &amp;c.&mdash;Empremiose
em a muy nobre e sempre leal cidade de Lisboa, anno 1562, in folio.</p>

<p>The complete title may be found in Dieze’s edition of Velasquez,
p. 87. The text of the dramas is printed in gothic characters, but
the introduction which precedes each piece is printed in the modern
roman type. In the dramas themselves the Portuguese and Spanish
languages are indiscriminately employed, and though the introductions
are chiefly written in Portuguese, some of them are also in
Spanish. I know of no later edition of Gil Vicente’s works. Barbosa
Machado mentions none of subsequent date. How can the Portuguese
public so completely forget an old favourite? Only a few of
Gil Vicente’s Autos were printed singly in the seventeenth century.</p></div>

The word <i>Floresta</i> has a two-fold meaning. In Portuguese
it usually signifies a flower garden or a park. In Spanish it also
bears the meaning of the Italian <i>Foresta</i>. Gil Vicente so frequently
confounds Spanish and Portuguese together, that in the present
instance it is necessary to guess the meaning he wishes to attach to
the word <i>Floresta</i>, which seems to be that of a flower garden.</p></div>

well written <i>Vida do Doutor Antonio Ferreira</i>, prefixed to the new
edition of Ferreira’s <i>Poemas Lusitanos</i>, <i>Lisboa</i>, 1771, in 2 volumes
octavo. This edition, though not remarkable for elegance, is printed
with tolerable correctness, and contains also the author’s dramas.

Ferreira in scanning, avails himself of the peculiarity of the
Portuguese diphthongs, in order to omit at pleasure, as in latin verse,
the <i>m</i> at the termination of words; for the Portuguese <i>m</i> in that
situation is not an alphabetic character, but merely denotes the
nasal sound which may also be marked by a circumflex over the
diphthongs according to the fancy of the writer. Ferreira, for
example, thus scans a line in his beautiful elegy on spring:&mdash;</p>

<p>Huns s’ou | vem, huns | nos tron | cos fi | cam escri | tos.<br /></p>

<p>
Here the <i>m</i> in the word <i>ouvem</i> concludes a metrical syllable,
which it does not in the word <i>ficam</i>.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_107" href="#FNanchor_107" class="label">107</a>
<i>Poemas Lusitanos</i> is a title which in the sixteenth century
no Portuguese poet except Ferreira would have applied to his
writings. The word <i>Poema</i> has never been received into the language
of common life in Portugal.</p></div>

Manuel de Faria y Sousa in his preface to the 4th vol. of the
<i>Fuente de Aganippe</i>, alluding to Ferreira’s eclogues, says, they are
written <i>con perdurable dureza y poca dicha en pensamientos y
afectos</i> (with tedious frigidity and but little happiness of thought
and sentiment.) As far as regards the eclogues, this observation is
not altogether erroneous; but in general Faria y Sousa was by no
means competent to pronounce an opinion on Ferreira’s works.

The allusion to this event occurs in the tenth canto of the
Lusiad, in which the goddess Thetis from the summit of a hill,
points out to Vasco de Gama the theatre of the future conquests of
the Portuguese. Thetis says, pointing to the coast of Camboya,
but without naming Camoens:&mdash;</p>

Barbosa Machado, in his dictionary says of Camoens:&mdash;</p>

<p>Salvou se em huma taboa com o seu divino poema, imitando a
Julio Cesar, que no porto de Alexandria em huma maõ levava la espada
e em a outra os seus commentarios.</p>

<p>In order to render the miracle perfect in analogy, Dieze in his
appendix to Velasquez, has applied to Camoens these last words in
which Machado refers exclusively to Cæsar. Inadvertencies of this
sort must be expected occasionally to occur in the history of literature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_135" href="#FNanchor_135" class="label">135</a>
The original source whence these biographic notices are
derived is, it must be admitted, somewhat obscure. About the
middle of the seventeenth century, a writer named Manoel Severim
de Faria compiled a biographical account of Camoens from the
poet’s own works. This biography served as a ground work for
Manoel de Faria e Sousa, who annexed a <i>Vida del Poeta</i> to his
edition of Camoens and his commentaries on the Lusiad. The facts
thus collected were afterwards rectified and arranged by subsequent
writers, and among others by Barbosa Machado. Manoel de Faria
attaches particular importance to the noble extraction and armorial
bearings of Camoens. He gives the passage from the letter which
the poet is said to have written on the approach of death, and
which Barbosa Machado has re-printed. The words are:&mdash;</p>

<p>Quem houvio dizer nunca, que em tam pequeno theatro, como
o de hum pobre leito, quisisse Fortuna representar tam grande desventura?</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p>Procurar resistir a tantos males, pareceria especie de desavergonhamento.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_136" href="#FNanchor_136" class="label">136</a>
The first edition of the Lusiad was printed in the year 1572,
and the poem itself was chiefly written in the East Indies. Tasso
read it, and praised the author in a sonnet which has been preserved.
The first edition of Jerusalem Delivered appeared in 1580, and
consequently, a year after the death of Camoens. (See the History
of Italian Poetry and Eloquence, vol. ii. p. 226.)</p></div>

Even the apology for Camoens which precedes Mickle’s version
of the Lusiad, defeats itself, for the English translator makes
the Homeric epic his standard, and in order to justify the Lusiad
misconstrues the machinery of the Iliad. The remarks on the
Lusiad by Voltaire, in his <i>Discours sur le poème épique</i> are
beneath criticism; and the judgment pronounced on this poem by
Von Junk in the introduction to his Portuguese grammar, evinces a
total want of poetic taste. No one should attempt a translation of
the Lusiad, who does not possess an intimate acquaintance with the
Portuguese language and poetry, for it is otherwise impossible to
seize the spirit of Camoens. The English translation by Mickle is
hitherto the only one in which it can be said that at least the elegant
dignity of Camoens’s style is represented.</p></div>

The edition with the commentaries of Faria e Sousa published
in the year 1636, has the old title of <i>Lusiadas</i>; but in the book
itself the poem is frequently styled the <i>Lusiada</i>. The latter title
is, therefore, far from being a recent innovation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_140" href="#FNanchor_140" class="label">140</a>
Camoens was no doubt influenced by the recollection of Virgil’s
<i>Arma virumque</i>. But in his opening stanza the Portuguese poet
alludes to the heroes of his native country, without distinguishing
any one in particular; and thus at the very outset the Lusiad differs
from the Æneid. The second stanza resembles Ariosto. The two
first stanzas are here subjoined in the original:&mdash;</p>

The first stanzas on the introduction of Inez or Ignez (for
the Portuguese orthography adopts the latter form of the name) are
not to be surpassed.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Estavas, linda Ignez, posta em socego,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De teus annos colhendo doce fruto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naquelle engano da alma, lédo, e cego,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que a fortuna naõ deixa durar muto;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nos saudos campos do Mondego,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O nome que no peito escripto tinhas.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As lembranças que na alma lhe moravam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que sempre ante seus olhos te traziam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quando dos teus formosos se apartavam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De noite em doces sonhos que mentiam,<br /></span>

<p>Among the succeeding stanzas it is difficult to make an election;
and as the specimens introduced in this work are intended to form a
collection for literary study, it is still more difficult to resist the
temptation of transcribing the whole episode. At all events the
following six stanzas must find a place:&mdash;</p>

This passage is one of the most celebrated in the Lusiad. It
commences with the following stanzas:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Se nos mostra no ar, robusta, e válida;<br /></span>

<p>But a stanza still more admired, is that in which the gigantic
spirit describes his rage on discovering that he was embracing
a rock, while he fancied he held in his arms the goddess of
whom he was enamoured:&mdash;</p>

The translator who undertakes to produce a good version
of the Lusiad, must, in the first place, adopt no other metre than
that of the original, for on the structure of the verse the style
of the poem materially depends. He must, moreover, diffuse over
the whole composition a character equally natural and dignified, and,
where mythological ornament is not introduced, perfectly simple.
Finally, he must avoid all antiquated and uncommon turns of expression;
for the language of Camoens is always elegant and modern.</p></div>

Manuel de Faria y Sousa was the first who started this
question, which is now generally decided against Diogo Bernardes.
Notices on this subject maybe found in the prefaces to the third
and fourth volumes of the new and elegant edition of the <i>Obras de
Luis de Camoõe, segunda edição da que se fez em Lisboa, nos
annos 1779 e 1780</i>. Lisbon 1782, in five small volumes. A mythological
and historical index to the Lusiad, though a very imperfect
one, enhances the value of this edition. The older editions of the
works of Camoens are noticed by Dieze in his appendix to Velasquez.
Manuel de Faria y Sousa’s commentary on the works of Camoens,
pedantic as it is, contains some useful historical elucidations.</p></div>

The first of these elegies commences very much like versified

to suppose he was perusing even the opening of an epistle. The
spirit of the composition does not begin to manifest itself until the
sixteenth line:&mdash;</p>

The principal idea of this song of sorrow, the beauties of
which are perfectly national, is the comparison of the present and
the past in the situation of the poet, with an imaginary Babylon and
Sion. Sion represents the past. The first half of the poem affords
no anticipation of the nature of the second half:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sobre os rios, que vaõ<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Por Babylonia me achei,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Onde sentado charei<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As lembranças de Siaõ,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">E quanto nelle passei.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Alli o rio corrente<br /></span>
<span class="i4">De meus olhos foi manado,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">E todo bem comparado,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Babylonia ao mal presente,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Siaõ ao tempo passado.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among the most beautiful stanzas are those in which the poet
celebrates the power of song in sorrow, and the limits of that
power.</p>

mentioned in terms of still higher commendation in the biographical
preface to the new edition of Ferreira’s poems. (See p. <a href="#Page_114">114</a> of the

of the various works of this poet, who is scarcely known on this

The word <i>desenganado</i> (in Spanish <i>desengañado</i>) is not so
happy an expression as the English <i>disenchanted</i>, or the German
<i>entzauberte</i>. It is the word commonly used to designate one who
is no longer enamoured. The <i>Desengaño</i> (the <i>disenchantment</i> in
affairs of love) is also employed by the Spanish poets as an
allegorical character.</p></div>

<p>Se alguem chorando canta, assi cantava hum pastor à vista do
Rio do Mondego, sentado sobre huma sepultura, cuja antiguidade a
pezar do tempo, et da inveja descobria a fama entre as ruynas de
huns derribados edificios na entrada de hum valle, a quem altos
Cyprestes, et outras funebras plantas faziaõ com carregadas sombras
morada eterna da tristeza. Corria o Rio alegre, et nunca tanto
atras da fermosa Arethusa o namorado Alpheo. Agora com
appressado curso, por se appartar das Ribeyras humildes, que o
perseguem, mostrava seu furor na crespa escuma, et logo desfazendoa
jà livre dellas hia mais vagoroso. Retratavaõse nelle
(como em espelho) os frescos arvoredos, que de huma, e doutra parte
o assombravaõ em cerrada espessura.</p></div>

<i>Rebello</i> is sometimes called <i>Rebelo</i>, and sometimes <i>Rabelo</i>.

are occasionally written <i>Gustino</i> and <i>Leonitas</i>, The <i>Constante
Florinda</i> has been frequently printed. The edition which I have

<p>Muytos servos há no Mundo, que sam servos do Mundo, os
quais sò com elle tratam seus negocios, metidos em os bosques de
cuydades mundanos, sustentando-se em os montes de pensamentos
altivos: sem quererem tomar conselho com hum livro espiritual que
lhes ensine o que devem fazer. Compadecido destes quis disfarçar
exemplos, et moralidades com as roupas de historias humanas.
Para que vindo buscar recreaçam, para o entendimento, em a elegancia
das palavras, em o enredo das historias, em a curiosidade
das sentenças, et em a liçaõ das fabulas, achem tambem e proveyto,

<p>Assim como os que navegaõ sobre as ondas do mar que enjoande
em hum navio, nem por se passarem a outro perdem a nauzea que
os atormenta, porque naõ nasce do lugar, senaõ dos ruins humores
que em si trazem levantados. Assim os tristes, et affligidos ainda

<i>Asia de Joaõ de Barros, dos feitos que os Portuguezes

For example, (in <i>Decad 1. livr.</i> iii. <i>cap. 2.</i>) Barros describes
Columbus as visiting the King of Portugal with a malignant joy
on his return from his expedition to America, and as acting the
part of an empty boaster. But was the discoverer of America a
braggart?</p></div>

The following is the commencement of the description of
the city of Ormus, which before the discovery of the new
passage by the Cape of Good Hope, was the mart for the merchandize
of India in its progress to Alexandria:&mdash;</p>

<p>A cidade Ormuz estâ situada em huma pequena ilha chamada
Gerum, que jaz quasi na garganta de dentro do estreito
do mar Persio, taõ perto da costa de terra de Persia, que averâ
de huma â outra tres leguoas, et dez da outra Arabia, et terà
em roda pouco mais de tres leguoas: toda mui esteril, et a
major parte huma maneira de sal, et enyofre sem naturalmente
ter hum ramo ou herva verde. A cidade em si he mui magnifica
em edificios, grossa em trato por ser huma escala, onde
concorrem todalas mercadorias orientaes, et occidentaes a ella, et as
que vem da Persia, Armenia, et Tartaria que lhe jazem ao Norte:
de maneira, que naõ tendo a ilha em si cousa propria per carreto
tem todalas estimadas do mundo. Porque atè aguoa, cousa taõ
cõmum, tirando alguma de tres poços et cisternas, toda lhe vem da
terra firme da Persia, della em vasilhas, et outra solta em barcas
cõ toda hortaliça, verdura, fruta verde et sorodea que despende, que
he em abastança: assi da comarca a que elles chamaõ Mogostaõ,
como destas ilhas que tem por vinzinhas, Queixome, Larec, et outras
com que a cidade he taõ vizosa et abastada, que dizem os moradores
della, que o mundo he hum anel, et Ormuz huma pedra preciosa
engastada nelle.&mdash;<i>Decada II. livr. ii. cap. 2.</i></p></div>

Of this an excellent example is afforded in the description
of the perplexing situation in which the Portuguese were placed at
the taking of the Indian town of Calecut, when confined in the
narrow streets, and overpowered by the fatigues of the combat,
they were in danger of being forced to yield to an enemy far weaker
than themselves:&mdash;</p>

<p>E certo que era cousa digna de admiraçaõ, et pera se muito
condoer de taõ triste caso, porque contemplando obra de seiscentos
homens que seriaõ os nossos, entalados entre aquelles vallos: tanto
sobrelevava o fervor do sol, et a poeira dos pés, et trabalho que a
noite passada té aquelles oras tinhaõ sofrido, sobre toda a força do
seu animo, que naõ se podiaõ defender de até otienta Naires, que
pela estrada os perseguiaõ derribando poucos et poucos: et o que
era maes miseravel, se de cima dos vallos lançavaõ naquelle cardume
dos nossos hum zarguncho, huma seta, huma pedrada, nunca dava no
chaõ, et qualquer que acurvava os pés de todos trilhando o acabavaõ
de matar. Finalmente aqui dous, ali quatro, seis, oito, sempre
foraõ caindo té que sairaõ daquella estreiteza do vallo ao largo da
cidade: a qual ainda que ardia em fogo, menos sentiraõ o que nella

The Portuguese Public is introduced speaking, in order to
represent in a forcible way the disapprobation with which the enterprizing
spirit of the Infante Henry was at first regarded:&mdash;</p>

ilhas que o tem maes elevado neste descobrimento, póde achar outras
terras hermas grossas et fertiles como dizem que ellas sam: terras
et maninhos ha no Reyno pera romper, et a proveitar sem perigo de
mar, nem despesas desordenadas. E maes temos exemptos contrarios
a esta sua opiniaõ, porque os Reyes passados deste Reyno
sempre dos Reynos alheos pera o seu trouxeraõ gente a este a fazer
novas povoações: et elle quer levar os naturaes Portugueses a povoar

<i>Commentarios do grande Affonso d’Alboquerque, &amp;c.</i> An
elegant edition was published at Lisbon in 1774, in four octavo
volumes. In order to understand this work the reader must not
spare himself the pains of learning the maritime language of Portugal.
The book will sufficiently repay this trifling labour.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_250" href="#FNanchor_250" class="label">250</a>
These celebrated Commentaries are written throughout nearly
in the style of the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>Passadas todas estas cousas, mandou o grande Afonso Dalboquerque
aos Capitães, que levassem suas amarras, e partio-se do
porto de Adem a quatro dias do mes de Agosto, e com toda sua
Armada foi á vista do cabo de Guardafum, e dali fizeram sua navegaçaõ
á outra banda da terra, e afferrâram Diolocindi, e foram correndo
toda a costa de longo, e chegáram a Diu, onde foram muito
bem recebidos de Miliqueaz, e bem festejados de dadivas, que deo a
todos os Capitães, e ali estave seis dias, e mandou concertar os
bateis das náos, que vinham muito desbaratados; e como chegou,
veio logo Miliqueaz velo á nào, e estiveram ambos praticando em
cousas desapegadas.&mdash;<i>Parte IV. cap. 12.</i></p></div>

<i>Monarchia Lusitana, composta por Frey Bernardo de
Brito, &amp;c.</i> The edition with which I am acquainted is in two
folio volumes. The first volume was printed in the convent of Alcobaça,
in the year 1597, and the second by a bookseller of Lisbon,
in 1609.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_253" href="#FNanchor_253" class="label">253</a>
In order to form a just notion of Brito’s rhetorical merit, it
is necessary to peruse the second part of his work, in which he
had no longer the opportunity of following the ancient writers; for
example, his description of the final stroke of fate which visited
the Visigoth King Roderick, who lost the decisive battle against
the Arabs. He thus describes how the king in his retreat took
refuge in the church of a deserted convent:&mdash;</p>

<p>Chegado el Rey a este lugar cõ desejo de achar nelle alguma
consolaçaõ pera seu spiritu, encontrou materia de mayor lastima,
et dobrado sentimento, por que os mõges atemorizados cõ a nova
que chegara poucos dias antes et solicitos por salvar os ornamentos,
et cousas sagradas, huns eraõ jà fugidos pera dentro de Merida, outros
se retiraraõ pella terra dentro buscando guarida em outros conventos,
et os menos aguardavaõ o fim do negocio dentro no mosteiro, desejando
acabar a vida pella honra et defensão da Fé Catholica dentro
naquelle santuario. Entrou el Rey na Igreja, et vendoa nua de
ornamentos, et desempesada de Religiosos, se pos em oraçaõ com
tanta dòr et angustia de coraçaõ, que desfeito em lagrimas, se naõ lembrava
que podia ser ouvido de alguma pessoa, aquem o excesso dellas
desse conhecimento de quem podia ser, et como a fraqueza de naõ
ter comido alguns dias, o desfalecimento do cerebro, pella falta do
sono, et o quebrantamento de caminhar a pé, lhe tivessem as forças
debilitadas, se lhe cerraraõ os spiritus, de maneira, que ficou em
terra com hum desmayo em que esteve privado dos sentidos a te o
achar hum monge antigo, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Livr. VII. cap. 3.</i></p>

With regard to these portraits, it may be observed that they
are not well engraved; but according to the assurance of Brito, they
were faithfully copied from the best likenesses extant. It would
not be easy to find a portrait of Philip II. of Spain, who is here
described as the eighteenth King of Portugal, which so decidedly
expresses the character of that austere despot.</p></div>

The Portuguese <i>Saudades</i> must by no means be confounded
with the Spanish <i>Soledades</i> in the style of Gongora. (See preceding
vol. page <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55829/55829-h/55829-h.htm#Page_435">435</a>). In the Portuguese word <i>Saudade</i> are singularly
blended the significations of <i>Saùde</i> (a salutation), and <i>Soledad</i> (the
Spanish word for solitude). Hence also the untranslatable adjective
<i>Saudoso</i>.</p></div>

Besides the <i>Fenix renascida</i>, which contains an account
of most of the Portuguese sonneteers of the seventeenth century,
there is a later, but upon the whole a much worse collection of the
same sort, which comprises only two volumes, though it extends
beyond the close of the eighteenth century. It is entitled:&mdash;<i>Eccos
que o clarim da Fama dà; Postilhaõ de Apollo, &amp;c.</i>
(Echos which resound from the trumpet of Fame, or the Postillion
of Apollo.) The title is still longer, and the remainder is in still
worse taste. The collection was published at Lisbon in the year
1761.</p></div>

In old Portuguese the word <i>Politico</i>, signifies all that belongs to
polite manners. Hence Rodriguez Lobo’s works are entitled, <i>Obras

sustains a principal character in these evening parties.</p>

<p>Acompanhavaõ na mesma quinta duas primas, et huma irmã
à fermosa Isabel, belleza tam adorada nos curtos limites de Villa
Franca, como applaudida nas melhores escolas de Lisboa: contava
<i>vinte Primaveras, tam filhas de seu rosto, que segundo os numerava
por flores, parece, que tirava os annos das faces</i>; entendimento
sem aquelles estrondos que levando as mulheres a cõpositoras,
lhe estragaõ o patrimonio de sezudas: vicio introduzido em as
Damas, que se passaõ da almofada à escola, et do estrado à academia:
como se natureza se deixasse vencer da industria, ou como
se no governo de hum recato, naõ tivera harto que fazer hum entendimento.
Era Isabel sezuda sem as affectaçoens de soberba;
retirada sem os melindres de presumida; &amp;c.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_329" href="#FNanchor_329" class="label">329</a>
The discourse is not satirical, and notwithstanding the trivial
nature of the subject, it recommends itself by style and diction.
It commences thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Nam ha mais dificil palestra que o do entendimento. Nos
encontros de Marte, se he varonil o animo, sempre sahe victorioso
o pulso:&mdash;nas contendas de Minerva, inda quando he claro o entendimento,
se nevoa tal vez o discurso. Naquelles atè com as
cegueiras triunfa a colera; nestas, inda com as perspicacias desatina
a agudeza. Nunca pasmou o animo o Alexandre no mais subito
assalto do inimigo, et suspendeo-se à vista do enlaçado labyrinto, que
se lhe offereceo no templo; porque o primeiro pertencia ao braço,
o segundo ao engenho. Monarca era Alexandre, naõ menos entendido,
que valeroso, et para que se visse quanto mais difficuldades
encontrava o juizo, que o valor, antes se resolveo a romper em huma
temeridade, que a aconselhar huma resolução. Cortou he huma
golpe o difficultoso laço: acabou a espada, o que temeo a agudeza.</p></div>

To the honour of Portugal this book has been frequently
reprinted. Its title is simply as follows:&mdash;<i>Vida de Dom Joaõ de
Castro, quarto Viso-Rey da India, por Jacinto Freire de
Andrada</i>.</p>

<p>Barbaso Machado’s catalogue states that the first edition appeared
in folio in the year 1651. A neat pocket edition in octavo
was published by a Lisbon bookseller in Paris in the year 1759.
The work was translated into English in the seventeenth century by
Henry Herringman, and shortly afterwards a latin translation was
executed by the Italian Jesuit Del Rosso, who in reference to
Andrada’s historical style, not injudiciously observes: <i>Elegantiam
sectatur, sed non ieiunam; acumen, sed minime illiberale</i>. To
men of education, wishing to learn the Portuguese language, there
is no book that I would more strongly recommend than this excellent
biography.</p></div>

<p>Entràraõ os nossos de envolta com os Mouros a Cidade, onde
os miseraveis se detinhaõ presos do amor, et lagrimas das mulheres,
et filhos, que acompanhavaõ ja com piedade inutil, mais como testimanhas
de seu sangue, que defensores d’elle; taes houve, que
abraçadas com os maridos se deixavaõ trespassar de nossas lanças,
inventando os miseraveis nova dor, como remedio novo; dos nossos
soldados, huns as roubavaõ, outras as defendiaõ; quaes seguiaõ os
affectos do tempo, que os da natureza. Algumas d’estas mulheres
com desesperado amor se metiaõ por entre as esquadras armadas a
buscar os seus mortos, mostrando animo para perder as vidas;
lastimosas nas feridas alheas, sem lastima nas suas.</p></div>

Cofar to the Turkish soldiers, who had followed him to India.</p>

<p>Companheiros, et amigos, nam vos ensinarey a temer, nem a
desprezar esses poucos Portugueses, que d’entro d’aquelles muros
estais vendo encerrados, porque nã chegaõ a ser mais que homens,
inda que saõ soldados. Em todo o Oriente atègora os acompanhou,
ou servio a fortuna, et a fama das primeiras victorias lhes facilitou
as outras. Com hum limitado poder fazem guerra ao mundo, nam
podendo naturalmente durar hum Imperio sem forças, sustentado na
opiniaõ, ou fraqueza dos que lhes saõ sugeitos. Apenas tem quinhentos
homens naquella fortaleza, os mais d’elles soldados de presidio,
que sempre custumaõ ser os pobres, ou os inuteis; por terra
naõ podem ter soccorro, os do màr lhes tem cerrado o inverno.</p></div>

A good account of the mode in which the Portuguese language
was disfigured by the introduction of French words and
phrases, may be found in the fourth volume of the <i>Memorias de
Litteratura Portugueza</i>, (Lisb. 1793,) in a treatise by Antonio
de Naves Pereira, on the language of the best Portuguese writers of
the sixteenth century. These <i>Memorias</i> must, in the course of the
present work, be more particularly noticed.</p></div>

Even a learned Portuguese, well acquainted with the literature
of his country, of whom I made enquiries respecting the fate

than that the institution was no longer in existence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<i>The Memorias da Academia Real das Sciencias de Lisboa</i>, in
which that academy exhibits its labours for the advancement of knowledge,
more particularly of the mathematical and physical sciences,
are totally distinct from the <i>Memorias de Litteratura Portugueza</i>,
which have been published by that academy since the year 1792.
These last <i>Memorias</i> consist partly of philological and critical
treatises on the Portuguese language and literature, and partly investigations
relating to the ancient history and constitution of
Portugal. The singular union of two departments so essentially
distinct, arose out of the French idea of <i>littérature</i>, which had
been adopted in Portugal. The worthy members of the academy
well might, as indeed they intimately did, find it difficult to
determine what was to be called literature. To reconcile all opinions,
therefore, they included under that title national history. Germans,
however, are by no means entitled to make this mistake, a subject
of reproach, while they continue to employ the comprehensive word
<i>literature</i> to designate merely the knowledge of books.&mdash;I have
seen as yet only six volumes of the <i>Memorias de Litteratura Portugueza</i>.
The sixth was published in the year 1796.</p></div>

Barbosa Machado, in his dictionary of learned men, gives a
catalogue of the writings of the Count da Ericeyra, including those
which remained unprinted up to the year 1747. None of these
unprinted works have, it seems, been submitted to the press since
that period, though they comprise a whole collection of the minor
<i>Obras Poeticas</i> of the author, together with several prose works,
on subjects of general utility; as for example, a <i>Methodo dos
Estudos</i> (Plan of Study.)</p></div>

I have seen two of these collections. The oldest, printed in
the year 1746, is entitled, <i>Operas Portuguezas que se representaram
nos theatros publicos desta Corte, &amp;c.</i> It contains
eight dramas in two octavo volumes. The latest collection is
entitled <i>Theatro comico Portuguez, ou Collecçaõ das Operas
Portuguezas que se representaram, &amp;c.</i> in two octavo volumes,
fourth edition, Lisbon, 1787. As to any merit which may be
discovered in these collections they are nearly equal.</p></div>

To shew that no injustice is done to the author, it will be
sufficient to quote some of the witticisms, by which Æsop distinguishes
himself in the first act:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Zeno.</i> Donde Esopo vás? Tu naõ ouves? Com quem fallo
eu?</p>

<p><i>Esop.</i> He comigo?</p>

<p><i>Zen.</i> Sim.</p>

<p><i>Esop.</i> Eu naõ me chamo Esopo Vaz, sou Esopo só, nú, e
espurio como minha mãi me pario.</p>

<p><i>Zen.</i> Aonde hias, entremetido?</p>

<p><i>Esop.</i> Se eu fora entremetido perguntára a Vossa Mercé
para que nos traz hoje a esta grande feira.</p>

<p><i>Zen.</i> Para vender-vos a todos tres, pois todos tres sois intoleraveis
pelas vossas manhas, porque tu és hum bebado, e tu hum
ladraõ.</p>

<p><i>Esop.</i> Visto isso, quem comprar a este sendo ladraõ, comprao
siza, e tudo. E eu, Senhor, quaes saõ as minhas habilidades, ou
virtudes?</p>

<p><i>Zen.</i> Saõ boas; primeiramente mexiriqueiro, e bacharel.</p>

<p><i>Esop.</i> Se eu fora Bacharel soubera Direito; seu eu soubera.
Direito eu me endereitára, e naõ fora corcovado; naõ he por ahi que
vai o gato ás filhozes; tem mais de que se accuse? &amp;c.</p></div>

<p><i>Xant.</i> Está com subtileza. Ora dize-me; como te chamaõ?</p>

meia hora que huns me chamáraõ Poeta, e outros carcunda.</p>

<p><i>Xant.</i> Pergunto o teu nome.</p>

<p><i>Esop.</i> Eu, Senhor, com perdaõ de Vossa Mercé chamo-me

<p><i>Xant.</i> Naõ me entendes? Em que lugar nasceste?</p>

<p><i>Esop.</i> Tambem naõ me disse minha mãi se me pario em
lugar alto, ou baixo; mas cuido que foi ahi a algures ao pé de
alguma cousa.</p>

<p><i>Periand.</i> Ennio, o escravo tem atacado ao Filosofo nosso
Mestre.</p>

<p><i>Xant.</i> Ou és mui simples, ou mui velhaco; pergunto-te, de
donde és natural?</p>

natural.</p>

These translations are anonymously printed, and have never
been regularly published. The design with which they are written,
renders them, however, the more deserving of being known, since,
according to the express declaration of the author, their object is,&mdash;“to
counteract the too great predilection of the Portuguese
nation for languishing pastoral poetry.” The commencement of

For example, in the following passage, in which Garçaõ

the charge of arrogance:&mdash;</p>

<p>Naõ creio, ó Arcades, que em vossos corações se pervertesse a
antiga sinceridade de costumes com taõ violenta metamorfose, que
para reconciliar-me comvosco me seja preciso cantar a Palinodia.
Vós estais offendidos? Eu ultrajei-vos? Havera entre Nós algum
espirito taõ escravo da vangloria, que naõ possa, nem se atreva a
soffrer a verdade? Chamar-me heis atrevido, porque sou zeloso da
honra, e do credito da Arcadia? Porque naõ sei lisonjear-vos com
fantasticas esperanças; porque vos naõ attribuo, se possivel he,
maior merecimento do que o vosso? Ou finalmente porque naõ me
atrevo a divulgar com soberba jactancia, que restauràmos a boa
Poesia, e a verdadeira Eloquencia? Que peleijámos, e que vencemos?

<p>Corre o tempo: ateia-se a epidemia; desprezaõ-se os bons
Authores; naõ vale o exemplo da Antiguidade; apaga-se a memoria
da Arte; e finalmente se transforma o genio da Naçaõ. Se no fim
desta Epoca apparecesse huma Alma capaz de atalhar o damno, acha
já com tantas forças o Inimigo, que ainda que adquira a honra de
atacallo, raras vezes cólhe os louros do triunfo. Saõ taõ frequentes,
e talvez taõ domesticos os exemplos, que naõ devo respeitallos.
Prouvera Deos, ó Arcades, que ainda hoje em Portugal naõ avultassem
mais as ruinas deste geral destroço, do que as miseraveis
reliquias da restuida Lisboa. Só huma Academia, huma Sociedade
de homens sabios, zelosos do bem, e da honra da sua Patria, he o
Alexandre que póde cortar este Nó Gordiano, he o Achilles de que
pende a expugnaçaõ de Troia.</p></div>

The selection of extracts contained in this work may be
closed by the following passage, which will afford a specimen of the
recent style of didactic prose in the Portuguese language. The
author is speaking of the value to be set on ancient and modern
poetry.</p>

<p>Mas este concurso de circunstancias parece, que ainda naõ foi
a causa suficiente da perfeiçaõ das Linguas: inda alli se diviza hum
vacuo, que precisa ser occupado. Aqui vem a Poesia com toda a
sua pompa e magestade, desatando os vóos, pulindo e aperfeiçoando
os Idiomas, dando a tudo alma e vida, já elevando-se aos maiores
assumptos nos louvores do Ente Supremo, e no panegyrico dos
grandes homens, persuadindo a imitaçaõ das acções nobres, e dignas
dos mais distinctos applausos. Ella lhe abre os seus thesouros; ella
os enriquece; ella lhes dá força, elegancia, e harmonia, sem o que
seriaõ huns cadaveres seccos, e inanimados. Sem a Poesia, nada
seriaõ talvez os Gregos, e os Romanos, que tanto enchêraõ o mundo
com o fama das suas victorias, com a grandeza das suas acções, e
muito mais com a perfeiçaõ, com que cultiváraõ todas as artes de
genio, de que tantos, e taõ admiraveis testemunhos nos deixáraõ
principalmente nos seus escritos. A Poesia pois, que tendo entre
os antigos hum caracter de harmonia muito diverso da Poesia moderna,
veio pela ignorancia dos Seculos a tal decadencia, que pouco
faltou para ficar inteiramente ignorada.</p></div>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
